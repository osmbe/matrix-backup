# matrix-private-backup

This repo contains the chat logs of the public OpenStreetMap Belgium Matrix channels.

You can either search through the chat logs either by search the txt files or json files.
This is done by adding `lang:text` or `lang:json` to your search query for this repo.
So for example: [searching only the txt files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aosmbe%2Fmatrix-backup++lang%3Atext+hello&type=code) | [searching only the json files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aosmbe%2Fmatrix-backup++lang%3Ajson+hello&type=code)

The txt files will only be the actual text, while the json files will also show you more metadata about the messages
