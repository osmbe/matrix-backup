```
These don't seem to be the same street:  http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=%20Michel%20Willemslaan#map=18/51.18052/4.37686

It's like the name of the nearest neighbour:  Dani√´l Herreynslaan attaches to Plein:  http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/27920127#map=19/51.18114/4.37479

I have no idea which one is correct at this point , I'll have to visualize the geometry data first.

If I visualize both geojson strings copy/paste, I really have to say : WTF is going on with WR data, it looks like crap!

http://geojson.io/#map=18/51.18105/4.37291
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 02:47:17 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the names don't match the data, and the data doesn't match with reality... how can we trust this data and build tools for it ?
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 07:53:59 - joost_schouppe: Empty names usually mean that the name is the same left and right. Squares are often modeled a bit strange, with all the streets on the square having one side with the square name.
On mobile, will look at the data later.
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 09:10:59 - joost_schouppe: I can't seem to het to geojson.io to visualize. But I checked in Lara (https://crab.agiv.be/Lara/), and there it seems like it is mapped in quite a strange way too. But I'm not sure it is wrong, and I'm not sure I see the same thing as you do
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 13:56:40 - @gplv2:matrix.org: There are plenty of identical R and L names.
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 13:58:09 - joost_schouppe: That's not a problem no?
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 13:58:22 - @gplv2:matrix.org: well, one of the examples (first one) is smack in the middle of buildings, there isn't even a road close to it, but it is about 100 meters from the street in question, so it's not a conversion issue or rounding or something.  I can't even choose what it belongs to.  Follow the links I've copy/pasted from top to bottom.
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 13:58:55 - @gplv2:matrix.org: Those are not a problem as long as the geometry is correct , which I still need to verify, I started with the exceptions,,  where R <> L name
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 13:59:13 - @gplv2:matrix.org: we just can't do Q/A on it unless we understand the data
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 14:00:03 - @gplv2:matrix.org: and it was just a sample, the first I investigated and it was already faulty

Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 14:00:28 - @gplv2:matrix.org: copy paste that here : http://geojson.io/#map=18/51.18124/4.37339
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 14:03:37 - joost_schouppe: I'll try again, again later, again on mobile
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 14:04:07 - joost_schouppe: In the worst case, we have to switch to grb or crab roads
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 14:04:58 - @gplv2:matrix.org: no problem , just giving you the headsup, this is few hours worth of work, don't expect anyone to follow immediately
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 14:06:33 - @gplv2:matrix.org: apparanty WR is also in latin1 encoding, and CRAB isn't  (or atleast doesn't blow an error during parsing), but I had a weird python crash that went away after forcing latin1 encoding.  would be awesome to export in utf8 instead.  Also the WR zipfile has errors in it.   I had to compensate for that too
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 16:29:47 - joost_schouppe: I'm confused about your example. I don't see a road in WR in the full dataset: http://play.osm.be/wegenregister.html#18/51.18130/4.37320/osm-Wegenregister GEOJSON
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 16:30:18 - joost_schouppe: that said, there are quite a few roads in WR that should NOT have a name, e.g. driveways that somehow took the streetname. Those are errors of course.
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 16:31:53 - joost_schouppe: are your starting files in both case .dbf? I've never managed to get .dbf's from a shapefile to be read correctly
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 17:21:44 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I don't need the DBF's
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 17:21:59 - @gplv2:matrix.org: The road is in the dataset
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 17:22:43 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I don't know why it's not in the diff view...
Sun, Oct 29, 2017, 17:29:13 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but I can read them fine, all the tools that support them never complain.

The problem is already there, so it looks like it is a source issue at this moment.
I'm running a back to back test to build the database again from scratch with some adaptations, hopefully I can find a way to fix this.
Mon, Oct 30, 2017, 17:03:43 - joost_schouppe: In my q-gis the new download is in the correct position

Mon, Oct 30, 2017, 17:21:48 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I find it hard to set up a reference systems in QGIS, it looks good but I think there is still an offset
Mon, Oct 30, 2017, 17:24:07 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I should be more clear:  It depends how QGIS opens it up, if it takes the wrong projection , that doesn't have anything to do with the data, I think the probem is there somewhere.  My new processing just finished so I will know quickly once I run the query
Mon, Oct 30, 2017, 17:26:02 - @gplv2:matrix.org: mmm, I changed from osm2pgsql (package) to building it from source and now the tables are latin1 in an utf8 DB.

Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:07:34 - @gplv2:matrix.org: actually, if you skip CRAB db, which is fine for this test, you don't need osmosis
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:10:33 - joost_schouppe: what is the EPSG you want to land at?
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:29:53 - joost_schouppe: I can't do that testrun, but I could reproject the WR to the EPSG you need, and you could have a look if that fixes the problem
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:32:51 - @gplv2:matrix.org: that's what the script does in fact
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:33:15 - @gplv2:matrix.org: thing is, I noticed the working DB I have (with WR), the geometries are saved as 900913
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:33:26 - @gplv2:matrix.org: this is a 9.3 PG
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:34:42 - joost_schouppe: so that's EPSG:3857 I suppose?
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:35:14 - joost_schouppe: because there's also EPSG:4326 which is  often confused I thing
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:35:33 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but recently if you use osm2pgsql  it creates a epsg 3857 database.
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:35:54 - @gplv2:matrix.org: If I end up with a 3857 it seems to be offset a few 100 meters
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:36:32 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but they should be the same imho, I'm I just going crazy ... 900913 is the same as 3857 , not ?  1st is just unofficial designation by google
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 10:37:08 - joost_schouppe: yes, that's what I thought too. Still thinking it might be a wrong definition at the source data

Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 11:22:55 - @gplv2:matrix.org: you have to transform it however

Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 11:23:41 - @gplv2:matrix.org: so you transformed to 3857 ?
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 11:23:53 - joost_schouppe: yes

Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 11:25:01 - @gplv2:matrix.org: let me try this, I have it fully automated, when I open up QGIS project I can see in 5 secs if it worked after parsing.
Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 11:28:03 - @gplv2:matrix.org: then again ... If I open up the original shapefile in QGIS, it looks good as well.. compaired to one of my PGSQL datasources with WR .  It has to be one of the tools messing up.

I've rebuilt the server maybe 15 times (full auto) and I parsed the stuff probably twice that , half manually.  Now ever since I got that file from joost_schouppe  it's running out of memory when I tried that, but what totally throws me off is that the original file does the exact same thing now, it's using up 28Gigs of ram to parse a 250MB shape file.  I think I hate python

Tue, Oct 31, 2017, 14:03:19 - joost_schouppe: I had to try two times before QGIS would write the new file. Maybe there really is some corruption in the source data

Er zijn toch veel spelling fouten zoals oa: Gentsesteenweg vs. Gentse Steenweg.  Meestal is dat wanneer die weg een gemeentegrens oversteekt veranderd die wat van naam, dus er zit ook goeie data in, zal proberen het meer visible te maken eerst, zodat je niet in de DB moeten gaan kijken adhv. de ID wat juist het probleem is.

Tue, Nov 7, 2017, 16:08:02 - @gplv2:matrix.org: quite interesting stats imho.  I have to check a few things, but it looks like GRB grew a lot since may
Tue, Nov 7, 2017, 17:50:40 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the new datafile has been created, still have to load it up in the webserver, but in case someone is interested:  http://debian.byte-consult.be/grb/
Wed, Nov 8, 2017, 15:28:05 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I managed to map all GRB buildings to an OSM counterpart, where in doubt I added fixme tags that will be notified by validating in JOSM.  Pretty happy with the results,  I had to delete some stuff as it's very hard to map (slopes/ entrances to underground garages for example).   the GRB database is in the best shape it's every been now.   I can move up to the tool and the proposal now!
Wed, Nov 8, 2017, 15:28:52 - @gplv2:matrix.org: no more 'verdieping' inside of it, instead, building=yes + a fixme note on building:min_level and building:levels
Wed, Nov 8, 2017, 15:29:22 - @gplv2:matrix.org: support added for piers, groyne , chimney etc.

Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:22:12 - Jonathan: @gplv2:matrix.org: Yes it is ! I publish every event we have and it's used for OSMBE official calendar on  http://www.osm.be/calendar.html
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:23:03 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I found the calender already.  I'm trying to figure out if there is an API endpoint (for bebot)
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:24:08 - @gplv2:matrix.org: it's the same as this one (content wise) I assume . https://calendar.osm.be/
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:24:20 - Jonathan: I looked for an API too but there isn't !
Maybe I can try to publish a RSS feed or something from Maptime so you could read that.
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:24:51 - Jonathan:  > it's the same as this one (content wise) I assume . https://calendar.osm.be/

Yes it is. Just an iframe (yeah... I know) included on http://www.osm.be/calendar.html
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:25:59 - @gplv2:matrix.org: That would probably be awesome.  I'm trying to aggregate all events.   Meetup .com has a very nice API in fact, but I want all events together, not really a problem they are on different sites,right now I hardcode events but that wasn't going to be permanent
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:26:19 - * @gplv2:matrix.org didn't hear IFrame at all ;-)
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:27:05 - Jonathan:  > That would probably be awesome.  I'm trying to aggregate all events.   Meetup .com has a very nice API in fact, but I want all events together, not really a problem they are on different sites,right now I hardcode events but that wasn't going to be permanent

I'll keep you updated ! Any recommendation on a format ?
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:28:18 - @gplv2:matrix.org: json would be awesome, but I already have an xml2json coded in node.js (bebot) so if xml is easier, go ahead, I'll transform internally.  the OSM api doesn't do json for all requests, the changeset list is in XML and I transform it to json before working with it.  so RSS feed is probably fine if that saves you time
Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:29:05 - @gplv2:matrix.org: if we can keep bebot calender in sync with the site, that's another great feature , with minimal work

Mon, Nov 27, 2017, 14:48:55 - Jonathan: That's what I read to create https://calendar.osm.be/

Tue, Nov 28, 2017, 10:03:36 - Jonathan: @gplv2:matrix.org: Yes, Maptime uses Jekyll ; and Jekyll generates the feed with event date as published date. Only the date is relevant, not the time.
Not ideal, I know, but I didn't find another way to do it (easily).
Bot works fine ! Awsome !

Tue, Nov 28, 2017, 11:34:35 - @gplv2:matrix.org: wouldn't it be better to skip the passed events, only mention the upcoming ?
Tue, Nov 28, 2017, 11:45:46 - Jonathan: @gplv2:matrix.org:  Yes, I thought about it too ; but the RSS feed generation from Jekyll does not allow such thing (the only option is to specify the number of posts in the RSS feed).
Tue, Nov 28, 2017, 11:46:29 - Jonathan: I manage passed/upcoming events in PHP on calendar side ; you can do the same in the bot I guess.
Tue, Nov 28, 2017, 11:55:59 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I can filter it, no problem.  Just have to create a real date, it was more thinking out loud concerning the feature

Wed, Nov 29, 2017, 14:17:01 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the help is just the top of the script in fact, sometimes annoying as whatever is there is printed as help
Wed, Nov 29, 2017, 14:17:40 - @gplv2:matrix.org: because you use calendar in the url, I wanted to give consistency

I just improved Nominatim Provider for [Geocoder PHP](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder) (PR merged soon) ;
I also created new Providers for [Geocoder PHP](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder) : 
- UrbIS
- Geopunt
- Service public de Wallonie
All of those providers are available here : https://packagist.org/?q=geo6%2Fgeocoder-php&p=0

But I'm starting to use more and more Zend Framework components :)
Fri, Dec 29, 2017, 17:19:48 - @gplv2:matrix.org: https://github.com/gplv2/pgBouncerHud -> latest project.... getting near completion , written in Laravel

Fri, Dec 29, 2017, 17:21:45 - @gplv2:matrix.org: it connects to a list of postgresql bouncers and gets stats, it was so easy to do this in this framework , aka a secondary DB connnection (pgbpouncer acts like psql server)
Fri, Dec 29, 2017, 17:22:31 - @gplv2:matrix.org: only thing I had to do is patch the core driver that launches an incompatible request for all DB connections, I had to change it in the vendor package.
Fri, Dec 29, 2017, 17:23:47 - @gplv2:matrix.org: in laravel for example, you just need to define `use Validator;` and then have a class function called rules().  And bam, server side input checking. stuff like that.

Sat, Dec 30, 2017, 14:59:46 - @gplv2:matrix.org: you know what the cool thing is about laravel, symfony and for example your code, you really recognize things from eachother, laravel uses half of symfony components, which makes those components rock solid, and it trickles down in some of your composer files :  "symfony/stopwatch": "~2.5" -> you can use all of those libraries in laravel too if you want, or in symfony too.   it's why I asked what framework before digging deeper, It looks so recognizable.

Wed, Jan 17, 2018, 10:36:05 - escada: But since Polyglot is in the EWG, he might push the idea somehow
Wed, Jan 17, 2018, 11:30:24 - @gplv2:matrix.org: that is just 1 line and it talks about the wiki, that is not the oauth2 support I'm looking for to allow 3rd party authentication using OSM accounts. what they mean by this is that you can use your openstreetmap credentials to login into the wiki instead of having 2 seperate accounts

Tue, Feb 20, 2018, 15:16:17 - @gplv2:matrix.org: it was a  cartesian product  instead of a join ( long akward silence from the devs now )
Tue, Feb 20, 2018, 15:16:33 - @gplv2:matrix.org: only took me 2 days to decipher it.
Tue, Feb 20, 2018, 15:16:50 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I think URBIS is going to experience some speedups soon :)
Tue, Feb 20, 2018, 15:19:36 - timcouwelier: Dare I ask why someone would go with a cartesian product?
Tue, Feb 20, 2018, 15:19:52 - @gplv2:matrix.org: that was the error

Tue, Feb 20, 2018, 15:21:34 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but del is a alias elsewhere in the view (it's really like 5 pages long, it's terrible)
Tue, Feb 20, 2018, 15:21:55 - @gplv2:matrix.org: so it becomes cartesian product-by-typo

Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:03:55 - joost_schouppe: any of you smart people know why the background WMS is so slow in this page? Is it the service itself or the website that shows it? (and how can I find out?)

Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:19:15 - @gplv2:matrix.org: tons of issues in that page
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:20:25 - @gplv2:matrix.org: in chrome: CTRL-SHIFT-I  -> watch it cancel all those request (after firing them). I only clicked the link
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:20:32 - @gplv2:matrix.org sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:22:02 - @gplv2:matrix.org: they explicitly disable caching as well
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:22:17 - @gplv2:matrix.org: `Cache-Control:private, s-maxage=0` header
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:23:09 - @gplv2:matrix.org: problem is located in the part that loads this link  : `https://provincies.incijfers.be//jive/Presentation/GetPresentationImg?width=1299&height=711&_=0&workspaceGuid=a3c371c7-29e8-4dd7-b7e0-b5ee99fbf7f3&printStateFlag=false&allLayersFlag=true`
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:24:50 - @gplv2:matrix.org: they load jquery atleast twice , different versions.  1.9 adn 2.2.4
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:38:37 - @gplv2:matrix.org: they do something odd simply put, the request seem to get launched overlapped and then cancelled (which can for example happen legitimately when you drag the map)  but I'm not dragging anything, I just opened the link.  So it's in software.  If you're on IE9 or less jquery-1.11.3.min.js is also getting loaded
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:39:53 - @gplv2:matrix.org: some really weird stuff in the code.  right after jquery is loaded (2.2.4) they check to see if it's defined, if not they load jquery-2.1.4.min.js  , which is really odd way .
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:39:56 - joost_schouppe: Hmm, maybe they start of asking for a tile, then based on the result decide they want another zoom level for tiles...
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:40:46 - joost_schouppe: I don't know much about their development team, but it seems they always rush to production because they implement tons of end user requests
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:41:14 - joost_schouppe: So I can imagine them not touching something if it works, and hence have messy code
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:41:19 - @gplv2:matrix.org: this thing is a headache
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:41:33 - joost_schouppe: Haha, sorry
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:41:53 - joost_schouppe: It is a really cool website to work with though
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:42:11 - joost_schouppe: Even though I'm posting issues all the time
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:42:27 - joost_schouppe: (I manage content, not fundamentals, for this website. That's basically my job right now)
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:43:05 - @gplv2:matrix.org: yea, that happens, that the action of displaying a loaded wms result triggers a slight pan, enough to cancel the pending load queue (read WMS call) and reload, this isn't effective nor economic , the main page is really huge, they don't really do ajax
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:43:37 - @gplv2:matrix.org: well, the looks of a site and the features say nothing about the implementation, gotta look under the hood
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:43:38 - timcouwelier: Try selecting multiple subjects. You'll get multiple map views ...  all reacting to the same scroll/zoom actions
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:43:42 - timcouwelier: doesn't help load times..
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:44:25 - joost_schouppe: Ah, yes, you can have up to four maps simultaneously
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:44:32 - @gplv2:matrix.org: looks like some sort of framework is being used, jive .. but I don't know jive personally
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:44:50 - joost_schouppe: Jive is their own closed source framework
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:44:52 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I'm still loading 4 maps since when tim gave his comment ...
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:45:29 - timcouwelier: Personal note: It's weird some of the data just loads as a table rather then a map.
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:45:47 - joost_schouppe: You can make all sorts of presentations, not just maps
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:45:55 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the problem is definitely in the `GetPresentationImg?` call
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:46:08 - joost_schouppe: The site will suggest all sorts of presentation modes, depending on the selection
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:46:20 - joost_schouppe: It's mostly about graphs actually, not maps
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:46:23 - @gplv2:matrix.org:  > Personal note: It's weird some of the data just loads as a table rather then a map.

they use ajax call for some of that data, just spotted this
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:46:40 - timcouwelier: Has nothing to do with the 'behind the scenes working of the map' (so not related to your question),  if it's selectable in a menu from the side of your map, you expect it to be mapped data.
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:46:56 - timcouwelier: At least I do.
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:00 - joost_schouppe: You just happened to start with a map
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:02 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the WMS calls are also slow btw
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:12 - @gplv2:matrix.org: average 1.5 seconds per PNG
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:22 - joost_schouppe: If you open the site without a personal history, it shows a landing page
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:35 - timcouwelier: Not sure how the WMS is called, but gdiviewer.agiv.be is also often slow on loading their tiles.
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:44 - @gplv2:matrix.org: which kinda makes sense seeing this : https://provincies.incijfers.be//jive/Presentation/GetPresentationImg?width=1242&height=711&_=542&workspaceGuid=2a28e3af-eca7-491b-912d-2a8eef69941f&printStateFlag=false&allLayersFlag=true
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:46 - joost_schouppe: @gplv2:matrix.org: but that's the wms fault, right?
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:50 - timcouwelier: and that's on one of their own services :s
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:47:58 - @gplv2:matrix.org: they load all 4 maps as a single PNG
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:48:35 - @gplv2:matrix.org: there's your answer ... the call is heavy too, so the WMS service isn't up to it, but I would not call that a WMS error, design isn't really genius either
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:49:06 - joost_schouppe: Ah yes, they do that with graphs too. First define the available space, then start filling it up
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:49:53 - joost_schouppe: What's my answer?
Mon, Feb 26, 2018, 17:53:17 - joost_schouppe: The wms itself, plus some strange design choices?
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:03:51 - @gplv2:matrix.org: sorry, I had to bail quickly yesterday
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:04:55 - joost_schouppe: Boss came in? :)
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:06:22 - @gplv2:matrix.org: Nah, had to catch my train. I was already skipping the one I wanted.  And I didn't like spending time alone at my desk with the only other person around me is someone that hates my guts because I automated everything and she feels job-threatened...
I think the way it works, it needs javascript debugging / optimizing, without looking at the code it a bit hard to say , it's almost all minified so it's hard to tell like that, but I think the WMS calls are probably too heavy
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:07:12 - @gplv2:matrix.org: can you imagine this: someone giving you shit because a job that took 1..5 hours now takes 60 seconds (setting up a PSQL cluster) pffff

Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:09:20 - joost_schouppe: Haha, yes, you're supposed to do that, keep quiet about it and from then on spend the saved time reading the newspaper
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:10:44 - joost_schouppe: More seriously, you should escalate that shit and if it doesn't help go somewhere else and explain them why you left the other place. "I'd like to work for people who appreciate productivity gains". That way you don't get hired by people you're going to hate
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:25:42 - @gplv2:matrix.org: it's her job I saved time for ...
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:26:59 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I can't just leave either, I'm really making too much there in order to quit over a chick that is in IT sector for 2 years,  I've thought about it tho.   but unless another job comes around with sort of equal pay I would take it.  my other collegues are fine tho
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:26:59 - joost_schouppe: holy crap

Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:27:55 - @gplv2:matrix.org: she found one error I made and stretches it out, I fixed 100 errors and kept silent (to her).  My mgr knows what I'm worth

Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:29:19 - @gplv2:matrix.org: well.... what they call a backup is like a periodic dump
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:32:23 - @gplv2:matrix.org: she got stressed out because I let the fix take a single day (calculated risk).  I did perform a manual dump when I knew.   so she's mad because allegedly  I forgot to enable to crontab job again (that happens).  but ignores the fact that a) starting from the second after a data dump you're in the same situation again technically b) she didn't stress at all while she was ignorant of the problem.  I'm really surprised that this place is still around.   Everything, the ticketing system, the move to vmware
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:33:04 - @gplv2:matrix.org: and I was working on a hotbackup script that is able to perform Point in time recovery, so fuck that datadump, It's almost useless
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:34:12 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the only reason you can actually download that DB is because Oracle is behind it and those guys are pro's.  (my mgr  +1 other).   the shit I see is insane,  VM's with single threaded program got 32 (V)CPU's assigned.
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 09:34:57 - @gplv2:matrix.org: 6 of them (4* 32 cpu's to waste).  almost all PGSQL DB's run on 8GB ram (which is what my laptop has)...

Last week I fixed a view (in their dev env) of 5 A4 pages tall with a typo in it that made it run for 8 hours, I fixed that to 26 seconds (it's their BI part).   and they want to go live next month.   nobody sees the problem except the DBA team.

But we'll get a space: so I documented everything I had to figure out myself.  during that process I discovered that the girl forgot a production machine that needs to be migrated to VMWARE cloud (from IBM PPC LPAR/VPAR setup).  she forgot a machine .... because she has never inventorised the whole setup.

what makes that even worse is the guy I replacing was a doctor in informatics, special guy who spent like 8 hours next to her trying to teach her stuff.  I wasn't hired for that, I don't mind explaining things, but I'm not going do that the whole day, everyone here kinda aggrees too that he overdid it.  now her expectations are unrealistic, I have real work to do, targets to meet and data migrations to perform. she can interupt me at any time and I will shell out time to teach her.  not enough.  But I want her to ask me questions, I'm not going to invent something to teach her every day..  
Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 10:14:04 - @gplv2:matrix.org: she told me numerous times that she was going to get fired because of me, while I arranged formal SQL training in the mean time, telling the team lead she needs it.  who's going to fire someone that they just invested in  ?  No-one.

Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 10:19:20 - @gplv2:matrix.org: so, be warned when you can't download URBIS data anymore, there's a bunch of wankers working on that project on DB's that have 8GB of ram.   the box I use for GRB processing has 128GB of ram, only needs to be online for a few hours so who cares.  The whole GRB dev costed me probably like 250 euro's in total (maybe a bit more).  excluding my time of course.

Tue, Feb 27, 2018, 16:36:59 - joost_schouppe: I can suggest they talk to you if they want an outsider's analysis

Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 12:04:02 - joost_schouppe: I'm confused with Github pricing. I'd like to have a pirvate corner at https://github.com/provinciesincijfers (just used for issue-tracking and documentation, not real coding), but it looks like organizations are much more expensive. But if I just pretend that provinciesincijfers is a person, it looks like I get all the features I need for 7 usd. Or is that fraud? :)
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 12:05:30 - escada: when you write " I just pretend that provinciesincijfers is a person", you might have answered your own question, not ? :)
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 12:06:01 - joost_schouppe: probably :)
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 12:06:31 - joost_schouppe: I can also say "hey, this is my private place to work together with people who may or may not be in my organisation"
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 12:06:42 - joost_schouppe: (which is kind of true actually)
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 13:07:54 - timcouwelier: That would make sense if the account was called joost_schouppe.
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 13:27:17 - Jonathan: joost_schouppe: Yes, if you're the only one to work on it so far, just take the "developer" plan :)

Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 13:28:41 - Jonathan: Or create another one, which would be "private/personal" ^^
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 13:29:03 - Jonathan: But the answer was indeed in your question : organization >> team plan :P
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 13:29:56 - Jonathan: And basically, Team plan is not more expensive since the 25USD includes 5 users :)
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 13:57:00 - joost_schouppe: But developer plan has unlimited external contributors, no?
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 14:49:11 - Jonathan: Yes, I think so :)
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 14:49:39 - Jonathan: And if you need private repositories, you can also use gitlab.com (unlimited private repositories for free).
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:07:08 - joost_schouppe: damnit, what is this? GitHub from the Aldi?
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:14:02 - joost_schouppe: looks basically the same, just a bit more liberal on the free license. I don't mind paying actually, the biggest problem is convincing the "normal" people I work with that this tool can work for them (just documentation, task and project management is needed)
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:39:45 - Jonathan: > GitHub from the Aldi?

Hahahahahahaha ... Not sure they would like that "name" :D

Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:40:22 - Jonathan: It's an open-source web-interface on top of GIT that provides similar features that GitHub (which is not open).
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:40:54 - Jonathan: I use GitHub for my open-source projets and GitLab for my closed source project ^^
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:41:31 - Jonathan: There is also bitbucket.org (which is free for private repo if I remember correctly).
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:41:56 - Jonathan: But I think people are so used to GitHub that every other "GIT web interface" looks strange XD
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:42:02 - Jonathan: (including me)
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:43:05 - joost_schouppe: Well, not for the people I work with. Except for the few I've managed to convince to have a look. I'm reluctant to offer something similar but different.
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:45:36 - Jonathan: I just wanted to give you "all" the options :P
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:47:11 - joost_schouppe: Yeah, the girls thing does look interesting. Self hosted is not really an option so no bitbucket
Wed, Feb 28, 2018, 15:47:34 - joost_schouppe: What on earth did I just say

Wed, Mar 7, 2018, 09:46:55 - @gplv2:matrix.org: it comes from the openlayer vector layer, it's a strategy inside openlayers.
Wed, Mar 7, 2018, 09:47:55 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the geojson comes from the 1st (GRB) database, this query is run on nr. 2 (OSM)
Wed, Mar 7, 2018, 09:49:44 - @gplv2:matrix.org: It's not a bbox btw, it's a geometry of a building.
Wed, Mar 7, 2018, 10:42:14 - timcouwelier: Ah, that does explain. Assumed that was the general query (and run within a bounding box) rather then noticing it's for one specific object. 497m¬≤ house and 6 hectare residential area both seem well.. big enough.

Perhaps it's badly formatted, geojson specs have different versions, for example when you have a crs defined, the latest version does not want that. Or the coordinates could be flipped.

Fri, Apr 6, 2018, 23:26:58 - @gplv2:matrix.org: You need a Featurecollection , like the link I used to dynamically create maproulette tasks , that one created a proper geosjon
Fri, Apr 6, 2018, 23:27:09 - joost_schouppe: I think in maproulette3 they will provide csv and real geojson (conversation about that might have confused me)
Fri, Apr 6, 2018, 23:29:21 - @gplv2:matrix.org: well, json is a notation, in fact it's programming code, it's a javascript way of defining multidimensional data structure.  In essence they are equal, but logically JSON doesn't have any requirements other than that it needs to be semantically correct.  geojson requires a certain format (aka schema) so it's like a more strict in how it should look like.  Both are always json

Fri, Apr 6, 2018, 23:32:09 - @gplv2:matrix.org: this 'header' is repeated for every task, so taking that out will probably require some javascript code to convert.
Fri, Apr 6, 2018, 23:35:12 - joost_schouppe: Hard to imagine noone has done that already. Anyway if we can just get some info out of it that would do already. Which shouldn't be too hard with some text parsing
Fri, Apr 6, 2018, 23:38:18 - @gplv2:matrix.org: GeoJSON is a spec for representing geospatial data in JSON format.  so there is no general-purpose JSON-to-GeoJSON converter because generic JSON contains arbitrary data.  If you want to convert this, it will need a specific script to extract the geojson parts and combine them somehow to make it consumable for QGIS
Fri, Apr 6, 2018, 23:39:08 - @gplv2:matrix.org: and that also kind of depends on what you want to do with it,   Put everything in a featurecollection or not, couple of ways you can do this.

Mon, Apr 23, 2018, 22:02:10 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I tested the backend automated build this morning and it had some issues introduced by the many changes I did in the last weeks, nothing drastically but it takes four hours from start to finish. I need to do the frontend, could use help there, it's written in laravel php framework. I think I still need four weeks or something, given that I can work on it a few hours per day. I could use some help there, if only for ping/pong ideas, it would speed things up being able to collaborate, for that I need a permanent backend, which will cost me some, I have a VM bill of 200 euro's last month alone. I take care of it via my company funds, once processed the data can be served using a smaller machine, I prepped the build this month to allow me to resize the VM.

Next to the housenumbers we also have `addr:flats`  to take into account, counting could probably be a criteria, but the cut/off would be quite arbitrary.  tbh, I think it's pretty good right now already.   a lot more accurate but we can't replace a mapper that thinks while he maps, humans are far more qualified to decide in the end.    But I'll consider it , it's a change in the backend API , not in the data processing, so it's not so hard to modify this as we go

I seem to have missed this one ....   I'm not convinced this will do us good.   What do you mean by number of address positions ?  there is `addr:housenumber` and `addr:flats` to take into account.    Any suggestions on where the cut-off would be ?   I'm trying to visualise this in my head where this could go wrong 
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:21:57 - timcouwelier: Top of my head (trying not to overthink it), I'd say 4 adresses within one building footprint are likely flats, esp. if combined with a certain building height.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:22:26 - timcouwelier: But I'm not familiar with how they are dealt with in CRAB to begin with
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:22:49 - timcouwelier: if CRAB implies 'flats' in adresses, my idea would be utterly redundant.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:27:05 - joost_schouppe: I'm guessing addr:housenumber are the "hoofdadressen" from CRAB, like 15, 16, 16A. And addr:flats are the "subadressen", where 15 can consist of "appartment" A, B, 001, 02 etc.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:32:06 - joost_schouppe: ok scrolling up a bit I guess I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to what's in addr:flat. Can someone point out the relevant explanation?
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:33:17 - timcouwelier: if that's how they are in CRAB, such presence would suffice to mark as appartments, but yea - I don't know by heart either

Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:39:21 - timcouwelier: addr:flats is the OSM tag, to indicate multiple numbers behind a common entrance door
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:39:41 - timcouwelier: Id have to look at actual CRAB data to see if it corresponds.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:39:47 - joost_schouppe: I meant Glenn's documentation

Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:40:35 - joost_schouppe: Every "flat" has its own address OR subadress
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:40:43 - timcouwelier: I was wondering if we could deduce a building being an appartment building just from CRAB data.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:41:13 - joost_schouppe: Whats the working definition of an apartment building?
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:42:11 - timcouwelier: Given we're aiming to deduce OSM-compatible tags, we have to go by the wiki voor building = apartments
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:42:34 - timcouwelier: A building constructed to provide residential accommodation arranged into individual dwellings/apartments/flats, often on separate floors. The tag can be used for both buildings where apartments are sold (often called condominiums, condos, or stratas in North America) and where apartments are rented.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:43:14 - joost_schouppe: Right
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:43:33 - timcouwelier: So to approximate that, one could go for 'within residential landuse, multple adress positions within building footprint and building heigher then X meters'
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:43:41 - timcouwelier: with X an arbitrarly chosen value.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:44:08 - joost_schouppe: So, no. You could get a decent guess if it's building:use=appartements OR building=appartements, but no idea at all between the two
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:44:11 - timcouwelier: But maybe CRAB has zero role at all in this (which is a perfectly fine conclusion), I was just wondering if it's any  help or not.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:44:43 - joost_schouppe: Building height won't help much, as their are small appartement buildings and huge city houses which have been subdivided
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:44:50 - timcouwelier: higher* or height greater than* , not heigher...
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:55:37 - joost_schouppe: CRAB is blisfully unaware of building history or property. And it even has a "special" relationship with buildings at all. Which is even more peculiar when you look at GRB. GRB also knows hardly anything at all about building properties.
Wed, May 2, 2018, 17:55:53 - joost_schouppe: Gebouwenregister will slowly change that, but that will take a while

best thing you can do is read the crab tool code and test with the tickbox and/or the wiki ....  https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Belgium/Using_AGIV_Crab_data/The_AGIV_Crab_Import_Website
Thu, May 3, 2018, 10:24:47 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I think it's probably more accurate to calculate the size of a building , surface are + height will bring back a pretty good guestimate of the number of floors and the surface living area.   it's pretty obvious a building in a residential area of 1000m2 isn't a simple house , the average size of an apartment being between 80m2 to 150m2 , take into account the number of addresses compaired to the living area , should output a number that can be used to help decide.     But don't forget that existing specific building values (not being building=yes) take precedence.   It might just be that we are trying to fix like max 5% of the objects here.
Thu, May 3, 2018, 10:25:21 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I think that would be better than just count the addresses.

Thu, May 3, 2018, 10:31:56 - @gplv2:matrix.org: look for `flats` , there only a small section on it, it's written by Sander who did the analysis back then.
Thu, May 3, 2018, 10:51:06 - joost_schouppe: Right, so it's just subaddresses, concatenated. Good luck with that :)
Thu, May 3, 2018, 11:07:28 - @gplv2:matrix.org: yea, I would not depend on those too much, it's an unregulated bunch
Thu, May 3, 2018, 11:20:33 - joost_schouppe: well it gives a reasonable indication of the number of living units in the building. But some appartment buildings have many "hoofdadressen" instead of using the more logical subadresses.

I've seen bigger prices, in 2009  I got an invoice from google for 30K euro's to perform geocoding request for 800 tracked units.  We had 3500 assets on GPS.  It didn't even matter to them that we geocoded on demand when a customer looked up his latest positions.  They also wanted a login in the application (!!) to spy on us.  That's when I started using OSM data (nominatim) with custom code to add postal codes to the addresses, which were not included back then.  A bit later I became a contributor. (Had a different username back then).  In 2011 I got serious about it.

Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:07:38 - @gplv2:matrix.org: that means it's redirecting correctly !
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:07:49 - @gplv2:matrix.org: that is the proper link

Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:08:16 - timcouwelier: and your goofy link gives the same 404 just different path
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:08:37 - @gplv2:matrix.org: 404 , not 403 ?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:08:45 - timcouwelier: 404 not found on the full link
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:09:04 - timcouwelier: yea 404. the 403's are only if I go by the IP midgard posted

Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:09:31 - timcouwelier: 78.47.211.64 <- this one
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:09:35 - escada: and if you replace metrics.improveosm.org with whatever the IP address was that we found for that server ?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:09:42 - @gplv2:matrix.org: by IP won't work, it's using virtual servers, it needs the hostname
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:09:50 - @gplv2:matrix.org: you need to use the name
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:10:19 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I already determined at the start it's using virtual server principle in nginx.

Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:10:54 - @gplv2:matrix.org: you need SNI support in your browser though, what version of browsers is it ?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:11:23 - @gplv2:matrix.org: https://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/iis8-sni-browser-support.htm
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:11:26 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: you can modify your /etc/hosts file
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:11:42 - @gplv2:matrix.org: is your browser supported ?  (it woud surprise me if it wasn't)
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:11:47 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: SNI failing would result in certificate warnings, not in 404s or 403s
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:11:51 - timcouwelier: firefox 59.0.3
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:12:04 - @gplv2:matrix.org: well, I think he's ending up on the correct server though, since it's redirecting
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:12:23 - timcouwelier: and internet explorer 11.0.9600.18978
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:12:54 - @gplv2:matrix.org: otherwise he would never receive the `navigable-roads/total-metric .. ` part in the url, that IS coming from the server through a redirect
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:13:53 - @gplv2:matrix.org:  > SNI failing would result in certificate warnings, not in 404s or 403s

that CAN be but doesn't have to be, a SNI problem could also mean he will land on the default webserver instead, not on the correct one
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:14:02 - @midgard:matrix.org: I curled from a server in the UK, it gave the same response
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:14:19 - @midgard:matrix.org: so it's not limited to belgium
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:14:21 - @gplv2:matrix.org: probably accompanied with a certificate warning, but using IP will also give you that certificate warning.
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:15:00 - @gplv2:matrix.org: is your curl SNI aware ?  I curled from 2 servers in the UK as well and it worked.  curl version needs to be SNI aware too
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:15:08 - @midgard:matrix.org: ```

Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:16:37 - @gplv2:matrix.org: so, it's not SNI related
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:17:23 - @gplv2:matrix.org: haha, this is great, on my laptop where the browser works, curl doesn't !
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:17:36 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but I get 404
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:19:00 - @gplv2:matrix.org: timcouwelier: what browser are you using ?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:19:36 - @midgard:matrix.org: i'm using firefox
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:20:15 - @midgard:matrix.org: and under no circumstances will i be installing chrome or chromium
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:20:15 - escada: for me it only works under Chrome. Firefox & Safari give a 403 (all three running on the same machine)
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:20:57 - escada: and under no circumstances will i be installing chrome or chromium
so you are not a web client dev :-)
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:21:33 - timcouwelier: Ive posted before - firefox 59.0.3 and IE 11.0.9600.18978
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:22:16 - @gplv2:matrix.org: 7.52 -> support SNI

Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:22:27 - @midgard:matrix.org: escada: my stuff just works in other browsers because i use the standards :speak_no_evil:
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:22:49 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but yea, now I recall I asked before.  so you have it in both browsers ?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:23:19 - timcouwelier: Yup and I've posted screenshots from both
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:23:31 - @midgard:matrix.org: @gplv2:matrix.org: does it use HTTP/2 in your chrome/ium?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:23:51 - @midgard:matrix.org: i get HTTP/1.1 over here in firefox and curl
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:23:52 - @gplv2:matrix.org: midgard: I think it might be a SSL problem, I see a 404 error on 1 script that complains about downgraded protocol, which usually means the cipher used  conflicts between client/server
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:24:05 - @gplv2:matrix.org: checking ..

Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:27:28 - @gplv2:matrix.org: you tried chrome ? I was about to ask
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:28:12 - @midgard:matrix.org: escada: no, actually i just don't use a lot of fancy smancy stuff. only time i really had a problem in the last few years was with key codes
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:28:21 - @gplv2:matrix.org: this is quite a strange problem and I've been doing this troubleshooting for a long time ..  there is something elusive going on here.
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:28:21 - timcouwelier: Yea just tried... This is well.. odd.
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:28:34 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but you get a 404 in chrome, a 403 in the other 2

yeah ;-)  with SNI support (the Host part).
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:35:18 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but.. it looks like the default cert is subject=/CN=mdpe.improveosm.org
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:35:41 - @gplv2:matrix.org: should not be a real issue since only when the request is made the correct certificate will be renegotiated.
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:36:06 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I get the same output btw.
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:36:38 - @gplv2:matrix.org: Ok, this is interesting.. I can reproduce this in the browser, in anonymous mode I have exact same problem
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:36:44 - @midgard:matrix.org: so the 404 too?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:37:14 - @gplv2:matrix.org: yea
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:37:28 - @midgard:matrix.org: aha
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:37:56 - @gplv2:matrix.org sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:38:26 - @midgard:matrix.org: what cert are you using in working, non-private chrome, @gplv2:matrix.org ?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:38:32 - @gplv2:matrix.org: so, long story short:  escada was right sending a message, they need to investigate this in depth as this is a server issue, not a client one
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:40:40 - @gplv2:matrix.org: midgard: don't now for sure, chrome doesn't let me view it...  since a few releases ago, I need to use FF to view it now
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:41:05 - @gplv2:matrix.org: FF->  reproduced 404 in normal mode
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:43:00 - @gplv2:matrix.org: they should work on `improveourwebsites` instead of improveosm ;-)
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:47:21 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I think I found it
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:48:15 - @midgard:matrix.org: what seems to be the issue?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:48:30 - @gplv2:matrix.org: default cert is subject=/CN=mdpe.improveosm.org -> seems to pose a problem after all
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:48:45 - @gplv2:matrix.org: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=metrics.improveosm.org
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:49:16 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the second cert in the chain has a mismathc
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:49:59 - @gplv2:matrix.org: they could use an SSL specialist   *whispers I'm available*
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:50:15 - @gplv2:matrix.org: their nginx is not well configured
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:52:16 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: so why does my browser accept a cert with Common Name mdpe.improveosm.org if i'm visiting metrics.improveosm.org?
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:52:58 - @gplv2:matrix.org: really weird my chrome accepts this after all.   but 404 directly in anon mode. I've deleted all the cookies I found, local storage and I still get to view the site
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:53:40 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: the TLS stuff gets stored somewhere else probably
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:53:50 - @gplv2:matrix.org:  > so why does my browser accept a cert with Common Name mdpe.improveosm.org if i'm visiting metrics.improveosm.org?

I don't know ... afaik browsers should tell it to fuck off
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:54:15 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but the issue is in the chained certificate it seems
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:54:45 - @gplv2:matrix.org: hold on
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:54:51 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I misinterpreted this one
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:54:59 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: in firefox the HSTS and HPKP info is stored in <profile dir>/SiteSecurityServiceState.txt
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:55:48 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: ah, the cert has a "subjectAltName" section
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:56:07 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the server offers 2 certificates, it doesn't know which one to serve until the hostname is known (SNI) .  So the default certificate is served at some point to handshake into a secure link.  it's not the 2nd in the chain as I said before, it's the 2nd certificate the server has in store
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:56:14 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: that's why our browsers aren't telling the server to fuck off
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:56:28 - @gplv2:matrix.org: yea, there is SAN records too
Mon, May 7, 2018, 16:57:41 - @gplv2:matrix.org: didn't look at those, but I'm leaning to the other direction again, this cannot be an SSL issue, even the 404 turns up under SSL.   This can be quite confusing, but looks likes the SSL stuff works ok, the nginx is however badly setup
Mon, May 7, 2018, 17:11:25 - @gplv2:matrix.org: it's gotta be an application error, something's looking at some request headers that aren't set or something alike.  they should investigate this in depth on their side.  don't think we can mitigate this locally
Mon, May 7, 2018, 17:12:26 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I have the same symptom on my own hosting with the 2nd cert.   but my SSL is much better configure ;-)

Thu, May 24, 2018, 11:51:29 - escada: No idea. Their current provider started adding items to the bill recently. I'll pass on your email address so they can contact you directly
Thu, May 24, 2018, 12:00:53 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I usually only do it for smaller organisations , I'm not doing the bulk WP thing infra.  I had a Drupal hacked yesterday of a sports club I train sometimes and that's when my supportive services start costing me money to fix that.   But I have a setup where Wordpress is automatically upgrades, including SSL keys etc.  not for Drupal though.  ask to send me a mail at glenn@bitless.be

I used to be able to download a few hundred megabyte with overpass turbo using this trick (https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/41137/overpass-turbo-without-map-rendering), but this query seems to be a bit too heavy
Sun, Jun 3, 2018, 11:03:30 - joost_schouppe: maybe with better syntax it would be lighter on the server?

Sun, Jun 3, 2018, 11:43:25 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: not a solution, but you should also include bicycle=designated on paths

Sun, Jun 3, 2018, 11:58:26 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: you should anchor the regular expressions (^ matches the start of the string, $ matches the end of the string) to speed it up and to avoid matching values like "mmmyesmaybe"

Mon, Jun 4, 2018, 13:46:11 - escada: But with OAuth, you can still use very different usernames on the different platforms. So an outsider won't be able to link the 2 accounts.

and I don't care that you have a multiple personality disorder or not :-), it just that the account you mentioned here is almost the same. That was odd.

Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:29:17 - escada: a postal code does not have a unique house number in Belgium. 2850 is a village, not a couple of houses (huizenblok)

Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:31:17 - escada: Google will recognise somehow that 1224XZ is a possible postal code for the Netherlands and work from there. But that some "smart" conversion of unstructured input data to structured data. This is where Google is stronger than e.g. Nominatim. Has nothing to do with the data, only with the input parsing.

Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:35:21 - escada: Depends on your needs. I would say <country-code>-<postal code>, street house number
but in the UK they seem to work with ZIP codes only 

Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:35:55 - escada: this really depends on the country. Countries have different address systems and the search depends on that.
Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:36:06 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: yes but people make typo's in streetnames
Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:36:13 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: and it's too much info
Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:37:44 - @_oftc_Midgard:matrix.org: if you're building something where users are going to type in addresses and make typos, you don't want to use nominatim
Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:38:10 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: that is why I came up with postal lookup
Tue, Jun 12, 2018, 14:38:14 - escada: What is your application ? If I need to navigate to a specific house in Belgium, I have to specify street + house number. The satnav in my car has voice recognition. If there is no exact match, it offers alternatives. That should work for typed text as well.

You can use `withOpenStreetMapServer()` function from the provider.
But please respect the Usage policy : https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/

For the install there will be two people traveling with the equipment, 
and I've reached out to some locals that were recommended. We should 
have enough people to get it done in the two days scheduled, but more 
hands are welcome.

If you're a local with the technical background to help install servers 
or experience moving equipment and interested and available on Wed July 
25th or Thurs July 26, please let me know off-list. The data centre is 
Equinix AM6 in De Omval, Oost, Amsterdam:

Thu, Jul 19, 2018, 07:42:56 - escada: Long-term, the remote hands are capable of performing most tasks, 
including installing new servers. Local help would still be useful, so 
if you're interested, also let me know off-list.

Tue, Sep 11, 2018, 11:11:27 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I can do this: setup DB of GRB -> address buildings -> replaced those with GR versions  , but I can't do it on meta data (as that is what we are fixing)  so it will have to work with GIS functions , but for that to work decently we'll need perfect matching polygons (or UIDN/OIDN matching).   I'm going to give it some more thought
Tue, Sep 11, 2018, 11:15:06 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I don't like that GR does not take Gba into account

Tue, Sep 11, 2018, 11:18:04 - @gplv2:matrix.org: damn, I need to wrap my head around the consequences of both.  we might just need to make some sort of a merge of both data.   Or perhaps just use the address nodes from GR and see if we can address the GRB parts with it.  I think that might even work (so we do it using GIS data instead of meta)

Tue, Sep 11, 2018, 11:29:59 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I'm not totally through the matter though, so I cannot be 100% sure of everything, need a bit more homework for that.  I have some idea's already on how to solve some of the GRB issues with addresses using GR data.  Either that or we make our own merge of CRAB + GRB data (which in all honesty doesn't look too hard to do) using geometry data.

Tue, Sep 18, 2018, 11:47:10 - @gplv2:matrix.org: python , golang ?
Tue, Sep 18, 2018, 12:10:54 - Jonathan: PCRE (with PHP)
Tue, Sep 18, 2018, 12:14:27 - @gplv2:matrix.org: and by block you mean grouping per digit ?
Tue, Sep 18, 2018, 12:19:21 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I guess what you find hard is getting PATTERN and END to match the regex
Tue, Sep 18, 2018, 12:20:05 - @gplv2:matrix.org: because the digits itself can easily be matched with a simple regex, but I assume you really need to check for the boundaries and then take the digits in between them
Tue, Sep 18, 2018, 12:21:14 - @gplv2:matrix.org: like `([0-9]+)\s?/g` would match and then group per digit (without space)
Tue, Sep 18, 2018, 12:21:29 - @gplv2:matrix.org: prepend a `/` to that

Indeed ^^

I wonder whether  this is faster and more readable code than matching PATTERS "numbers" END and then split numbers on space ?
Wed, Sep 19, 2018, 10:06:58 - @gplv2:matrix.org: It's called PCRE because they came from perl but this library is implemented in other languages like php with some minor nuances.
Wed, Sep 19, 2018, 10:08:59 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but when you have the regex right, it's more reliable imho, it will detect this pattern anywhere in text, no need for manual detection etc.  you need to account for doubles for example ,  I don't know the source text how it looks like in detail.   I've been checking source code I wrote with plenty of regexes and the only solution I think that works is in PHP 7, I have php5 locally.
Wed, Sep 19, 2018, 10:17:01 - timcouwelier: A case of the old 'ah, I did that before but no clue anymore how exactly without checking the code' aye?

Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 12:43:41 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: *strict
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 12:44:10 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: it's good to interact about OSM and it's usages
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 14:00:46 - timcouwelier: However, this is in essence a matrix/riot chat, which is just bridged to IRC for convenience  - Jonathan has a point.
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 14:04:04 - escada: on Riot, you can create "private" rooms to chat with a selected number of people.
given that you only come here to chat with Jonathan on Geocoder related stuff (which seems to be without interest for the rest of us), it might be better to set up a private room for the two of you (no pun intended).
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 17:41:40 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: timcouwelier and your point it ? this channels is kinda dead
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 17:42:07 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: it's more debating the debate then doing something usefull there
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 17:42:58 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: escada same for you, I don't see what's wrong with, it's not that black.white as it's debated. 
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 17:56:03 - timcouwelier: My point was your argument about this being IRC was invalid. And it‚Äôs not meant to be a high volume chat anyway
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 18:13:04 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: timcouwelier you sound like a controlfreak, non high volume ? you want a community or not... sounds actually strange to me also that you guys seperated yourself from OSM itself
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 18:13:06 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: anyways, be my guest ;)
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 18:13:35 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org: just reasons to have reasons, make it a private channel then
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 18:15:10 - @_oftc_Hispano:matrix.org left the room
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 18:55:52 - joost_schouppe: Well I don't know why Hispano is so bothered, BUT this place was explicitly meant to be high volume tech talk and is from time to time only vaguely related to OSM. Now if Jonathan doesn't want to talk about something here then Hispano should respect that. But I don't think it was necessary to all join in on that.
Mon, Sep 24, 2018, 19:59:13 - Jonathan: I don't mind talking about Dev (obviously) but with Hispano it's only related to Geocoder PHP which is (almost) completely unrelated to OSM that's why I prefer switching to GitHub.
Tue, Sep 25, 2018, 09:57:35 - @gplv2:matrix.org: He's got an attitude problem.  Don't worry about him.   He comes in and decides we're not doing anything useful by looking at a days worth of chat.  It doesn't matter anyway, this is our IRC/matrix corner hence we make up the rules.  He should communicate on the github issues so the discussion is public.
Tue, Sep 25, 2018, 09:58:45 - @gplv2:matrix.org: btw, how are we separated from the OSM community exactly ?   We are the .be community üòÜ
Tue, Sep 25, 2018, 10:18:28 - escada: escada same for you, I don't see what's wrong with, it's not that black.white as it's debated. 
The only reason you come here is that you want to chat to 1 person. You post "Peek XXX" in at least 2 rooms, and don't care to post the real question until he arrives. That is my main problem.
Just post the question or whatever you have to say (and perhaps mention the person you want to speak to). If you are lucky some other people can reply before Jonathan can answer the question.

If we should not know about your conversation (that is how it appears to me), you should not bother us.
Tue, Sep 25, 2018, 10:24:22 - @gplv2:matrix.org: He left the room Marc.  Don't bother.
Tue, Sep 25, 2018, 10:28:06 - escada: but it also explains my way of thinking to Joost ...

Tue, Sep 25, 2018, 11:01:16 - timcouwelier: If he's calling me a controlfreak, he's trying to insult me. If my boss does that, it's a compliment. Oh the funny aspects of human interaction.

Thu, Oct 18, 2018, 14:59:01 - joost_schouppe: off topic (again, sorry). I have detailed polygons (Flanders=10.000 polygons) and I have general polygons (Flanders=300 polygons). The smaller polygons should add up to the bigger polygons. They kind of do, but not exactly. So I was wondering if there is an automatic process to "snap" the outlines of the small polygons to the outlines of the bigger polygons. It seems like an obvious problem, but I couldnt find the right way to search for an answer. Key to the solution is that if you merge the smaller polygons accorind to an attribute, they will respect the outlines of the bigger ones, except for some slivers. It is in removing the slivers that there could be a solution.
Thu, Oct 18, 2018, 20:43:53 - timcouwelier: I'm not sure what you're trying to do. Are you sure which is the more 'correct'?
Thu, Oct 18, 2018, 20:45:56 - timcouwelier: Id say merge the 300 polygons into one, intersect with the 10.000 version, so you have the 'silvers' of what's missing in the 300...  Merge the appropriate parts with whichever of the 300 polygons seems appropriate
Thu, Oct 18, 2018, 20:46:18 - timcouwelier: (thats assuming the 10.000 version has more detail, and the simplified 300 looses some accuracy due to simplifcation)

Fri, Oct 19, 2018, 11:28:36 - @gplv2:matrix.org: postGIS frickin rocks.  I would put both data sets in a PG db, run some queries (update) , but it could also be a join.  then export in the format you want.  http://www.postgis.net/docs/ST_AsGeoJSON.html

Do you know what I find weird in Google's implementation ?
Sometimes the street is located in the wrong village, until you also add the house number.
As you might remember we had to implement that thing here at Agfa. When I start typing my home address it only gives the street in the neighbouring village (where there is no such street, but they have the border wrong), and only when I type the house number, they correct the village.

I would like to know if that would be useful to ask for an extension of our authorization with the SPW and ask to include the address data (it is technically open now, and I already got a subset on my municipality to test). It would be useful to add addresses if they don't exist... (and we could make the postal code polygons at the same time ahah).
Mon, Feb 25, 2019, 13:18:50 - Jonathan: > it is technically open now

I have to disagree with that ... Still have to sign some paper to have access to it üòï

But indeed if Glenn's tool could be "easily" adapted for PICC/UrbIS that would be awesome.
Mon, Feb 25, 2019, 13:39:30 - timcouwelier: Polyglot: the only belgian I'm aware of that's been doing QGis plugin editing is Kay Warrie, who made the GeoPunt4QGis plugin.

üòÅ And they told me that we could extend the current agreement for the imagery and include icar address. Apparently they can't change the process to get the data while the picc is not yet open, but it is "open" under an undetermined license (but I suppose that a written agreement would be OK for us ?).
Mon, Feb 25, 2019, 15:54:12 - Jonathan: Yes, an agreement like the one we already have for WMS services is perfect.
I guess it could even be an addendum to the current agreement (extension of the agreement to ICAR/PICC database).

Thu, Feb 28, 2019, 08:39:49 - @gplv2:matrix.org: shapefiles are so wildly supported it makes sense to use them, so many tools to work with them.
Thu, Feb 28, 2019, 08:43:01 - @gplv2:matrix.org: Ok, I'm going to create a repository on OSM for that ICAR parsing with the crab tool, it needs some modifications still but I think it looks quite good.   I'm going to rebase the github repo to drop the history as it's quite huge.   Like that we can collaborate.
Thu, Feb 28, 2019, 08:45:15 - @gplv2:matrix.org: does anyone know what the Dependabot checkbox is on github OSM repo ?  looks like a github app or some sort
Thu, Feb 28, 2019, 08:47:38 - @gplv2:matrix.org: for the DNS, I suggest we set up a CNAME to icar-import.osm.be from crab-import.osm.be .   Not really urgent, but it might be interesting in order to  share this in public.

Thu, Feb 28, 2019, 09:37:47 - lionel_giard: Yes, and we can test it with the small part I shared and then, it should work when we will have the full data + license :-)

Thu, Feb 28, 2019, 16:57:17 - lionel_giard: Maybe they will be there next monday at Open Belgium conference, so that we can ask them directly ahah but otherwise i will ask them by email to make an addentum to the current agreement. üòÉ Do you think i should ask for the 'ICAR full address list' at the same time ? As i think that we could check the list of existing "spatial" addresses (i.e. like the file i gave you that came from the PICC, where they have matched most of the addresses with buildings) vs the FULL list of addresses (including the one that don't exist spatially, and i saw that's mainly sub addresses (like the more recent splitting of number 2 into 2A, 2B, 2C ... (the number 2 get a point on the PICC and not the others)). Then, we could check if these "address without spatial location" already exist in OSM (i know that we add some during survey) so that we can give feedback to the region and maybe help improve the data. In any case, i should ask how could we share feedback on spelling mistakes or factual errors (like the number that should be the number 20 but is noted as 1592463 (probably an id that was copy/pasted in the wrong field üòÅ)). [Do you give feedback to the region in Flanders for errors in the data ?]
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 08:36:37 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the full list
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 08:36:51 - @gplv2:matrix.org: there are no subaddresses in this file, and the crab/icar tool supports those
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 08:38:43 - @gplv2:matrix.org: maybe it's best to ask both, just to see what we can do with it.   There is for example a field I'm missing `herkomst` in crab, I didn't find that in this extract, it's an indicator of the quality, but not crucial to the parsing.  It was actually easier than I thought to modify this.   I did keep the variables naming to match crab , e.g  (nl) NIS = INS  (fr).
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 08:40:26 - @gplv2:matrix.org: we don't really give feedback imho.  We can use a tool called LARA to report mistakes but I find it a huge hassle, it should be easy to report errors not hard.   I don't think I ever got a response on what I reported (except canned replies)
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 08:45:48 - timcouwelier: Isnt reporting errors you spot a req in the license to use the data?

Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 08:58:45 - @gplv2:matrix.org: <@timcouwelier:matrix.org "I tried reporting an issue once...."> really ?  so what happened ?
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:01:23 - timcouwelier: We were working on a RUP.
Sometimes, when the designation for an area chances, something kicks in called 'Plancompensatie'
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:01:48 - timcouwelier: which is essentially a financial thing that calculates in the value difference for the pieces of parcel affected
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:02:12 - timcouwelier: The described method to do so uses data from GRB and from landbouwpercelen.
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:02:34 - timcouwelier: In one particular case, one of the parcels at the outer edge of the RUP got clipped in GRB by a water surface
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:02:52 - timcouwelier: thus rendering an incomplete 'area balance'
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:03:10 - timcouwelier: While cadaster clearly shows the parcel should have a proper accute angle.
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:03:38 - timcouwelier: I asked about being allowed to 'fix' the parcel shape to counter that, based on the parcel geometry in kadaster
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:03:47 - timcouwelier: which is why the ministry of finance got involved somehow
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:06:29 - @gplv2:matrix.org: omg
Fri, Mar 1, 2019, 09:06:40 - timcouwelier: Don't remember the exact outcome, but having a look at GRB I think they tweaked GRB.

Someone tries to save his work but one of the node has been deleted meanwhile (by someone else I guess) ...

Any idea how to save the work anyway ?
Should I revert the node ?
Wed, Mar 27, 2019, 20:58:57 - timcouwelier: delete the node in the changeset that's 'hanging', upload it, make another changeset to fix the node if needed?

Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 11:23:54 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I think it's because I wasn't sure about the street-ID column
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 11:24:59 - @gplv2:matrix.org: in AGIV that is clear, but the data model of ICAR deviates a bit, we need the street-ID in the code because it's unique and referenced in other places.   If you could determine this, would be great.   I'll show a record it's failing on.. hold on

Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:36:23 - timcouwelier: What would you suggest? Add a check for the presence of an x and y coordinate before processing?
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:36:37 - timcouwelier: Can you estimate what percentage of data points lack geometries?
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:37:13 - lionel_giard: There are 500k address without x,y that's weird (a lot are sub address with boite number but not all)
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:38:01 - timcouwelier: So with 500k adresses its weird he got to line 115 before failing...
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:38:37 - timcouwelier: Is there any 'logic' that would allow 'sub adresses' to be merged/linked with 'main adress with geometry' Glen could build on?
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:38:45 - lionel_giard: Bu t yeah apparently we have 500k out of 2 millions without geometry
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:39:48 - timcouwelier: I was more expecting something like 0.3 percent failures, rather then 25 percent.
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:40:01 - lionel_giard: They exist probably but need a locatiob
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:40:05 - timcouwelier: (and yes, 0.3 is a number I just made up, not based on any actual analysis)
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:41:48 - lionel_giard: At least for the import tool we can remove the one without geometry, and the only thing would be to have the list of these available (to download) so that a mapper can check if they exist. As we are allowed to give feedback to improve the data. ;-p
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:42:50 - timcouwelier: Hence me asking you: do you feel like most of the adresses without geometry (assuming sub-adresses) could get a duplicate geometry from a 'base adress' ?
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:43:00 - timcouwelier: (and are we talking point or polygon geometries?)
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:43:13 - lionel_giard: Point only here !
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:43:52 - lionel_giard: Looking on it, that's not only sub address so it can just be the municipality that added their address without the location.
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:44:16 - lionel_giard: Yes some municipality are bad at working on icar data ahah
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:44:43 - lionel_giard: I saw addresses noted as validated that never existed so...
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:44:45 - timcouwelier: Can you reference the hit/fail ratio for adress to the communities they are within?
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:45:15 - timcouwelier: So are some municipalities doing good work and others haven't bothered, or is it 'sub-par across the board'?
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:45:24 - timcouwelier: (if you're going to give feedback, might as well make it count)
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:48:48 - lionel_giard: At least 46 municipalities are 95%+ complete and validated but that's mostly digitalized municipality like Wavre (and soon La Louvi√®res) . others vary in their effort and 6 absolutely do nothing
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:48:50 - lionel_giard: Ahah
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:49:38 - lionel_giard: We have to understand that not all have 1 employee to pay to validate and locate address ^^
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 14:58:34 - lionel_giard: (For the address without geometry, I checked my street, it is all new addresses : either new construction or subdivision of one parcel (sub address) - so I suppose that's a lack of work from the municipality worker that only added the values and not the location. ;-p 
For @gplv2:matrix.org there were no point without geometry in the first export, so that's why it worked out of the box. So we need to clean the dataset of the addresses without geometry (there are column x and y at the end of the table that can be checked if null) and just use the others. Maybe provide a link to download the full table without geometry in the future but that would be another story. üòã
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 20:14:21 - @gplv2:matrix.org: it would make sense that this fails then
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 20:14:31 - @gplv2:matrix.org: as it is the line before the coordinates are extracted
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 20:15:17 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I'll make a patch to see what happens.   It's strange that there aren't coordinates in it tbh.  the tool kinda depends on streets being complete
Tue, Apr 16, 2019, 20:24:25 - lionel_giard: yep and that's something we could propose with the errors found/improvement when we send feedback (if we add the same address based on survey -> then we will have the coordinate). That's one thing i will try and see if that help them. I have already seen few addresses that i found in the field, but not in the dataset AND i mapped a few of the addresses without a geometry. ;-)

So they probably just released the same dataset as csv and shp, where they probably cleaned the shp before ! ;-) I don't know for empty streetnmid, i only checked the addressid :p

Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 12:29:11 - @gplv2:matrix.org: EPSG4326 is just the way to identify WGS84 using EPSG.
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 15:01:52 - timcouwelier: and EPSG:31370 is lambert72.
So EPSG:31370 is an SRID, stating EPSG as authority and 31370 as identifier?
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 15:02:19 - timcouwelier: Or is that still just a CRS?
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 15:28:15 - Jonathan: Just see both SRID and CRS as a Spatial Reference System (or Coordinate Reference System), it's easier :)
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 15:28:47 - Jonathan: More details on Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID) here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system#Identifier
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 15:30:43 - Jonathan: For the CRS `WGS 84`, `4326` is the SRID (identifier).
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 16:29:16 - lionel_giard: Yep in geography we don't make a difference between the two indeed, one is just the numeric ID of the other. BTW epsg is petroleum related (European Petroleum Survey Group) as they were the first that needed a spatial reference system for the world ahah

Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 18:34:58 - lionel_giard: timcouwelier: Don't use shapefile nowadays, you can use OGC geopackage (derived from SQLite DB) in 1 file with none of the shapefile problems, and lots of improvements (it's also the fastest format in QGIS) - it can contains multiple layers as it is a DB - it can contains the metadata and even the QGIS project i think ;p. 
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 19:09:41 - @gplv2:matrix.org: spatialite is also an option
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 19:10:00 - @gplv2:matrix.org: https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index

Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 19:11:32 - @gplv2:matrix.org: It might be a good idea to start from the border with flemish part, it's going to be a lot of work when you want to match administrative boundaries , roads etc.   lots of thinking work
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 19:12:27 - @gplv2:matrix.org: But the postal code thing, there is no flemish town where a postal code is fully embedded in another one.  hence I do doubt a bit about the results in general
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 19:13:33 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I tried finding one, perhaps I haven't looked hard enough.   To the people that mapped the flanders one, I bow to them.
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 21:10:32 - lionel_giard: I also used spatialite before, but since QGIS 3.xx i switched entirely to the new format. Geopackage seems to be superior to spatialite (both are SQLite based) - as it is a geographic standard from the OGC (while spatialite is just a spatial format among others). It is designed to replace shapefile a the defacto standard when doing spatial analysis... It's new but modern and get all the bonus from spatialite + some others things. And if you use QGIS, you'll find that the processing speed is multiple times faster when using geopackage than any other format (as it is optimised for it) - and you can directly save into the existing database when outputing results. So it makes data processing easier than ever - and also exchanging the dataset as it is one file (like spatialite). 
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 21:12:26 - lionel_giard: Wave can base ourself on the existing postal code of the Brabant Wallon too (they seem to be correct at least when i compared them to the concave/convex hull...).
Wed, Apr 24, 2019, 21:14:30 - lionel_giard: (btw one good advantage of geopackage is that you can delete column in the attribute table more easily than spatialite -> you don't need some tricks to do it ^^)
Thu, Apr 25, 2019, 09:07:30 - joost_schouppe: oh I tried geopackage once or twice in the new QGIS (I'm stuck with 3.2.1 since I don't have admin rights on work PC) and it failed hard...

Thu, Apr 25, 2019, 10:36:48 - lionel_giard: The only real downside, is if you have old plugin in Python 2.x then it needs to be ported to python 3.X

Mon, Apr 29, 2019, 10:13:35 - joost_schouppe: for Flanders: use QGIS, install the Geopunt plugin. It has a batch geocoder
Mon, Apr 29, 2019, 10:13:58 - joost_schouppe: it is limited to 500 records by default, but in the settings you can adjust the limit

Mon, Apr 29, 2019, 10:26:49 - joost_schouppe: yeah, I think it's something that only exists in Flanders along the East-Flanders - Hainout border (and is more common in South Belgium)

Mon, Apr 29, 2019, 10:51:33 - Jonathan: As you wish :)
We can give it a try like this ; it's also good to see how my geocoder works with a "random" dataset.
Mon, Apr 29, 2019, 12:14:19 - joost_schouppe: looks like maybe the excel was sorted by column without sorting all the data????$

Mon, Apr 29, 2019, 13:17:05 - timcouwelier: I applied a filter to select everything apart from the fields that had a 'car brand' matched, used 'selecteren speciaal' (only visible rows) and then a 'paste special' on a different sheet
Mon, Apr 29, 2019, 13:17:36 - timcouwelier: not sure why/how but it may have created an offset somehow

Tue, May 7, 2019, 17:28:05 - Jonathan: AFAIK there is no decent official postal code boundaries available :/
Tue, May 7, 2019, 17:28:49 - Jonathan: Actually there is no official postal code boundaries at all (geometry I mean, if course).
Tue, May 7, 2019, 17:34:41 - juminet: It should correspond to the old communes boundaries, no? I have a shp of these old communes (<1977), but I doubt it is released as open data.
Tue, May 7, 2019, 17:47:16 - joost_schouppe: it could, or it could not. I suppose you refer to NGI AdminVec. It is "somewhat open data" now
Tue, May 7, 2019, 17:48:11 - joost_schouppe: if the ICAR data shows postal codes are likely to follow the part-municipalities (the "old communes"), than one could indeed copy that geometry
Tue, May 7, 2019, 18:05:48 - timcouwelier: I think cadgis is open, no?
Tue, May 7, 2019, 18:05:52 - timcouwelier: that should have them too?
Tue, May 7, 2019, 18:07:39 - joost_schouppe: meh, not really I think. There are some rough approximations I believe; it might be useful. But not to be taken as an absolute reference.
Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:09:06 - lionel_giard: From my observation when looking at this data (ICAR...), most of municipality have only 1 postal code as far as i found looking at it (except big cities like Charleroi, Namur, Mons, Li√®ge, ...). It is pretty rare to have multiple postal code in the same municipalities apparently (at least in the Brabant Wallon and the few parts that i checked - it may be just bad luck for me ahah).
Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:12:42 - Jonathan: I'm pretty sure that big cities like Namur, Li√®ge, Charleroi, ... have multiple postal codes.

Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:25:47 - Jonathan: In this case, we were talking about Wallonia ! Pretty sure Bruges is not part of Wallonia (yet ?).
That being said, I indeed missed the fact that lionel_giard indeed mentioned big cities.
Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:25:58 - joost_schouppe: Haha
Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:26:26 - Jonathan: (indeed)
Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:26:38 - joost_schouppe: Using icar it should be quite easy to verify which municipality only has one postal code. And then we can quite easily add them to OSM!
Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:27:21 - lionel_giard: Yes in theory, but in practice there are a lot of small errors when they entered the postal code and they put the wrong one for 1 address in the municipality screwing this :D
Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:29:45 - lionel_giard: https://www.bpost.be/site/fr/envoyer/adressage/rechercher-un-code-postal you have the list of postal code here in table file (excel...) so we can just use that as the source to determine if one municipality only have 1 postal code no ? That's surely public information isn't it ?! üòã
Tue, May 7, 2019, 21:32:27 - Jonathan: That's what I use for postal code reference indeed !

Mon, May 27, 2019, 17:42:14 - juminet: lionel_giard: hey lionel. I took some time to analyse the (mis)match between ICAR and OSM adresses in my area. That's quite interesting: I found some mistakes in the ICAR dataset (spelling of street names), and also some errors in OSM. I just wrote a blog post: http://www.nobohan.be/2019/05/27/1-844-932-adresses-a-verifier/. let me know what you think!

Mon, May 27, 2019, 17:53:01 - lionel_giard: Like the spelling mistakes, it should be easy to fix in icar for the responsible in the municipality. And if they have good argument, no database is 100% correct, and we can both be correct or none can be correct :-p

Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 13:50:24 - joost_schouppe: anyone know why the hashing here doesn't work properly anymore? https://play.osm.be/historischekaart.html#13/50.7294/4.2783/osmbe-overlay_spwhill-overlay_dhm_hill
This used to bring you directly to the selected layers, but now starts with the default selection (ngi 1873+osm roads). If you open the link, than paste the url again, it DOES go to the right place. Made in Leaflet
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 14:38:07 - Jonathan: Yeah, just made some tests ;
It seems to work locally but not on https://play.osm.be/historischekaart.html ; very strange...
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 14:40:34 - joost_schouppe: didn't work locally for me either
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 14:41:03 - joost_schouppe: might just be some code hygiene issues
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 14:42:56 - Jonathan: Could be or the order of the things load.
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 14:43:12 - Jonathan: The documentation of Leaflet Hash plugin is not really verbose either :/
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 14:43:35 - Jonathan: Do you want me to do some cleaning (just in case) ?
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 14:45:46 - joost_schouppe: you're of course welcome to (but I should clean up my own mess, no? :))
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 14:48:47 - Jonathan: Hahaha, no worries. I'll give it a try :)
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 15:28:26 - Jonathan: It should be fixed.
But the URL may have changed ; for instance, your URL is now https://play.osm.be/historischekaart.html#11/50.8398/4.4247/OSMBelgium-SPWHillshadeWallonia-AIVHillshadesoftFlanders
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 15:29:33 - Jonathan: joost_schouppe: The "important" files are now here : https://github.com/osmbe/play/tree/master/js/historischekaart
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 21:12:21 - joost_schouppe: very clean indeed :)
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 21:21:53 - lionel_giard: that looks awesome to have the hillshade overlay :D
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 21:22:18 - joost_schouppe: Yes, it's fun!
Mon, Jun 10, 2019, 21:22:39 - joost_schouppe: and really useful when you're hiking in a forest
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 17:16:04 - joost_schouppe: Anyone understand this enough to know if I should be pro or against this? All sounds very reasonable to me, until I realize I don't know what the hell he is talking about half the time
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 17:16:07 - joost_schouppe: https://gravitystorm.github.io/osmf-infra-plans/
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 17:45:31 - timcouwelier: I understood up untill the 'ideas' section. I'm not expert on the tech matters I'm afraid.
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 17:45:47 - timcouwelier: So I'll forfait the right to an opinion on this part
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 19:45:39 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: i'm against Amazon but the other items make sense
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 20:51:14 - pietervdvn: joost_schouppe: I stand with midgard. All good ideas, as long as the hosting is not one of the big companies (amazon, microsoft or googe). But yeah, that all sounds like great and necessary steps. 
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 21:08:19 - joost_schouppe: he didn't explicitly propose that, right? just "that kind of service" or "that kind of storage logic"?
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 21:26:20 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: Amazon was explicitly mentioned
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 21:26:47 - s8evq: I think it mainly makes sense. In the sysadmin world, you wil have people who will come up with a different solution. But that's typical.  I think the problems or issues mentioned are certainly valid. I'm not 100% sure of the container argument,  but that could be personal bias. Perhaps also worth considering is the current knowledge of the sysadmin team with these technologies.
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 21:27:46 - s8evq: Basically,  what is written in "The two or three next steps", sounds very realistic and reasonable to me.
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 21:29:57 - s8evq: Concerning Amazon: I'm also not a big fan. But on this level, I think you need to consider working with the big companies.  Doing everything in house is no longer realistic, as also written in his post.
Thu, Jun 13, 2019, 21:30:46 - s8evq: You can still choose for example Hetzner, a German company. But it's a commercial company as well, in the end...
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 06:42:10 - Jonathan: joost_schouppe:  I actually do like his ideas. I definitely think OSM infrastructure need some cleaning/restructuring/consolidating.
And even though I hear midgard and pietervdvn concerns about Amazon, I do agree with s8evq : at this level, you need some big companies. There are plenty of other players so we don't need Amazon but we need a big one, we can't host everything on our own anymore. I do'nt know Hetzner but there are Digital Ocean, Scaleway, OVH, ...
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 06:50:15 - escada: We deployed our application via Digital Data in Japan. Guess what, they decided to stop in Japan less than a year after we started there. So now we have to move everything to another provider. This is more likely to happen when you go with a smaller player. So I'm with Jonathan and s8evq on going for a big enough player that will probably have lower prices as well.
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 07:50:52 - timcouwelier: 'we' as in your 'day job company' ?
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 07:51:04 - escada: yup
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 08:22:24 - joost_schouppe: Thanks for all the feedback! Sounds like a possible move to a large hosting company would be discussed quite heavily. For me it always boils down to "are we an open source project into mapping or a mapping project that's into open source".
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 08:23:39 - joost_schouppe: Is there any of the Amazon-like platforms that is less toxic but as "stable"?
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 08:24:55 - joost_schouppe: Or would the combined open community be able to pull this off together? (Wikimedia, us, qgis, etc)
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:00:27 - escada: What do you mean with that last sentence ? Do you want to set up your own hosting provider together with the others?
If not, you always depend on your hosting provider and then you always depend on a third party.

Here, a small probably trustable provider made a mistake and suddenly all your network traffic is routed over China: https://blog.apnic.net/2019/06/07/large-european-routing-leak-sends-traffic-through-china-telecom/
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:04:25 - joost_schouppe: I don' -want- to do that, but I was wondering if that's a crazy idea or just a slightly crazy idea
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:13:16 - escada: Yesterday I was thinking that chosing between Amazon and Hetzner is a bit like a buying in a supermarket vs. a convenience store. (or actually any chain of stores vs an independent shop).
The bigger the more evil. Also, the bigger the cheaper. etc.
You probably have to pick a provider that is big enough to grow with OSM, but not so big that it is evil (evil meaning corporate share holders being more important than customers).
But isn't there a tripping point where every growing company become evil ?
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:23:08 - Jonathan: > I don' -want- to do that, but I was wondering if that's a crazy idea or just a slightly crazy idea

I think it's (unfortunately) unrealistic.
It would be a great project but hosting an infrastructure is a completely different job and I think it's out of the scope of our projects (OSM, Wikipedia, ...).
Let's focus on what we master (in our case, building a map) and use the tools at our disposal.
I personnaly don't mind using AWS/Azure (I put Google Cloud out of it on purpose) services but it will probably be an issue with part of the community.
The choice of the hosting company will definitely be a though one to "crack" and I guess I some point someone (OSMF) will have to pick.
Plenty of variables come into consideration when choosing a hosting company, it will depends on what matter most (price/green/"evilness"/...) and I think that's up to the OSMF to tell what matter the most for OSM.
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:24:47 - Jonathan: IMHO, the hosting doesn't matter much as long as it's stable and affordable.
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:27:11 - joost_schouppe: I wouldn't say it doesn't matter - we should try and avoid problematic companies as much as possible. But if that's too hard and the "evil" companies have too many advantages for the project, I think that should take precedence
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:28:01 - Jonathan: The "problematic" in "problematic companies" is really subjective unfortunately.
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:28:12 - escada: +1
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:34:33 - timcouwelier: On the 'evil' part and the 'turning point'...
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:35:04 - timcouwelier: it's a classic theme/quote, that not only applies here.... 'You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain'
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:36:39 - escada: or the grumpy old man (I already feel in that stage :-) )
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:37:10 - timcouwelier: You're aware Grumpy Cat died right?
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:37:58 - timcouwelier: Don't make me nominate 'Grumpy Dog'. And maybe, just maybe.. 'grumpy old man' IS the turning stage :o
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 09:40:55 - escada: I was not aware of the dead of the cat.
I've never been a hero, ...
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 10:16:42 - joost_schouppe: escada: you don't count as grumpy in OSM. To qualify you need to start your messages with "sigh", "here we go again", "as I explained over and over again before", "the three same people on the mailing lists will disagree, but" 
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 10:19:32 - escada: I would love to use all of those phrases each time I see Paul Johnson writing that lanes should include bicycle lanes. but I don't want to discuss that anymore.
Does üôÑ also counts ? üòÜ (insider joke for those reading the forum)
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 10:19:58 - joost_schouppe: yes it does
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 10:20:28 - joost_schouppe: I would propose anyone replyin anywhere to miser üôÑ starts their message with  üôÑ
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 10:24:29 - timcouwelier: they eye-rolling isn't grumpy... it's just trolling. Speaking of our favorite troll, just replied to a forum remark of his.
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 12:11:46 - pietervdvn: s8evq: Yeah, I'm not a fan of doing all inhouse as well. And yes, Hetzner is a commercial company, but it is a company which does what it advertises: host computers. Amazon is getting quite well-known to start invading privacy and getting anti-compititive... So, you get the point.
Anyways is using Hetzner - it's pretty bare bones. OSOC mostly works with Digital Ocean - they have a little more service for a few extra bucks. OVH is dirt-cheap but regularly under attack. Never heard of scaleway. In the end, these are decisions to leave up to the sysadmin what they prefer.
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 12:16:10 - s8evq: true.
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 12:17:53 - s8evq: In my opinion, the choice of provider is secondary. Perhaps more important is to get everybody on board for the idea that the infrastructure needs to be made more modern (eg virtualization, storage, dockers, avoiding single point of failure etc...).
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 12:18:02 - s8evq: And the article mainly is about that.
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 12:26:06 - Jonathan: Exactly :)
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 14:14:59 - pietervdvn: I can only agree with that as well
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 14:17:04 - escada: me too
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 16:10:30 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: dockers are fine iff people know what they're doing
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 16:13:03 - escada: I would hope that the people in charge of the OSM infrastructure know what they are doing, not ?
Fri, Jun 14, 2019, 16:13:36 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: exactly
Sun, Jun 16, 2019, 11:45:44 - Jonathan: Just something I forgot to mention : let's be sure (whatever the hosting company) to choose datecenter in Europe so we don't fall under the Patriot Act and those nasty laws.
Sun, Jun 16, 2019, 16:35:02 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: also a company that's not from the US
Sun, Jun 16, 2019, 16:35:36 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: https://www.privasectech.com/time-to-consider-which-jurisdiction-your-data-is-stored-in/
Sun, Jun 16, 2019, 16:36:26 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: (nowadays, not only where the data is stored matters)
Sun, Jun 16, 2019, 18:34:45 - escada: At this moment we already have deployments all over the world.  This means either a big international player,  or a lot of local negotiations
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:30:02 - timcouwelier: Not sure who to ask...
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:30:12 - timcouwelier: but can THIS please be added to JOSM ? and maybe ID?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:30:13 - timcouwelier: http://opendata.apps.mow.vlaanderen.be/opendata-geowebcache/service/wms?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:30:25 - timcouwelier: WMS server for 'verkeersbordendatabank'
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:30:34 - timcouwelier: Modellicentie Gratis Hergebruik - v1.0 applies.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:30:48 - joost_schouppe: Isn't that data hugely outdated?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:31:53 - timcouwelier: Some of it is bound to be yes. But it's not like a majority of signage was changed, no?  Probably wouldnt hurt to include a 'base year' in the layer name though to clarify
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:32:02 - timcouwelier: I was unaware it was properly accessible by WMS now
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:32:10 - joost_schouppe: Uh yeah me too
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:32:27 - joost_schouppe: Looks interesting enough, I'll have a look at it and maybe ask them a few questions
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:33:10 - timcouwelier: basically I'm looking for their map 'afgeleide snelheidskaart' based on the data
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:34:58 - Jonathan: Ping me if you want me to add it to JOSM and iD ; I became quite expert in those kind of additions :P
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:36:01 - joost_schouppe: Lemme have a look first
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:36:25 - joost_schouppe: Is there any way to add explicit warnings on quality to those things? Or name only?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:37:39 - timcouwelier: I mean - Jakka would probably LOVE this. Especially signage on exceptions for C1 and C3 signs.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:40:33 - timcouwelier: Shame however the pages like this: https://opendata.vlaanderen.be/dataset/toplagen-van-de-genummerde-wegen-in-beheer-van-awv/resource/cb675881-fe57-4bc8-8de2-d4223f014fe3
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:40:47 - timcouwelier: lack attribution. The default layer is OSM-based though and named as such.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:41:22 - Jonathan: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Is there any way to add explicit..."> There are plenty of extra fiels.
Here is the detail : https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Maps#Generalproperties
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:41:41 - joost_schouppe: Cool
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:42:03 - Jonathan: *extra fields
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:42:29 - Jonathan: I guess you can use `description` to explain what we should/shouldn't use the service for.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 15:43:36 - timcouwelier: Don't suppose anyone knows if the attributes for their 'speed-map' are linked in Wegenregister data?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:38:02 - joost_schouppe: timcouwelier: writing to opendata vlaanderen now
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:38:31 - timcouwelier: Had a look in the downloadable shapefiles
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:38:37 - timcouwelier: it's not an attribute field there.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:39:09 - timcouwelier: What in particular are you writing about btw?  License is the same as GRB, iirc..
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:41:45 - joost_schouppe: uh about the lack of attribution on https://opendata.vlaanderen.be/dataset/toplagen-van-de-genummerde-wegen-in-beheer-van-awv/resource/cb675881-fe57-4bc8-8de2-d4223f014fe3
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:42:02 - timcouwelier: ah right.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:48:22 - joost_schouppe: oh wow it even has cycle network indications it seems
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:49:33 - timcouwelier: Looking at a dataset of speedlimits for antwerp I found though opendata.vlaanderen.be
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:49:41 - timcouwelier sent an image. (Media omitted)
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:49:47 - timcouwelier: side by side OSM (through overpass) and the data from Antwerpen
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:50:22 - joost_schouppe: the speed data is outdated in Halle, not just on municipal roads but also on AWV roads
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:51:59 - joost_schouppe: seems better on the main axes though
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:52:37 - timcouwelier: Where do you see speed limits in Halle btw?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:52:58 - timcouwelier: the WR data itself doesn't have a fielt for speedlimits, and the antwerp dataset is just antwerp...
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:53:16 - timcouwelier: I know AWV has a dataset for speed limits on their own roads, but not overall?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:54:16 - timcouwelier: and oh, https://opendata.vlaanderen.be/dataset/snelheidsregimes-langs-de-genummerde-wegen-in-beheer-van-awv does have attribution.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:54:51 - joost_schouppe: I'm looking at the traffix sign layer your shared
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:55:21 - timcouwelier: ah okay.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:55:27 - timcouwelier: as for the attribution, I think there's a pattern
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:55:40 - timcouwelier: the initial page looks like my last link, and has attribution.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:55:54 - timcouwelier: But if you go to the link to 'preview' the data, those pages lack it.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:56:31 - timcouwelier: ( https://opendata.vlaanderen.be/dataset/snelheidsregimes-langs-de-genummerde-wegen-in-beheer-van-awv/resource/8bc3eeee-6696-4770-a4d8-d86c0980a537 ) is the counterpart link for my previous )
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:57:33 - timcouwelier: But as for data being 'up to date' - I do agree it's such a pity even the 'default 70 km/h rather then 90' and the changes that implied on the C43 signs didn't get processed.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:57:53 - timcouwelier: I can hardly walk up to city council and whip them untill they fix it, can I?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 16:59:31 - joost_schouppe: de "zichtbare infrastructuur" layer has trees along the road
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:00:35 - joost_schouppe: can you paste that overpass query for the speeds?
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:01:05 - timcouwelier: https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/K6v
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:01:31 - timcouwelier: could probably be shortened alot with nwr use, but if it's not broken I'm not fixing it.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:02:58 - timcouwelier: It's just convenient to see if you've left any 'gaps' after adding speed limits, or figuring out where they are missing to begin with.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:03:29 - joost_schouppe: oh wow, my street is supposedly NOT in bebouwde kom
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:03:39 - joost_schouppe: I didn't even know they changed that the last ten years
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:04:28 - joost_schouppe: but then the zone 30 in the city center looks generally OK
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:05:21 - timcouwelier: On a (non-dev) sidenote: I'm actually fairly impressed with how Antwerp deals with the zone 30 for residential areas. Very consistent, where in my own backyard it's usually a case of 'we eventually think we should do this...'
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:07:53 - joost_schouppe: funny how they still have a lot of pribate driveways in that data
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:08:06 - joost_schouppe: that's pretty new policy in Antwerp too
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:08:16 - joost_schouppe: especially in the "important streets"
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:08:55 - timcouwelier: Over hear it means 'we can't get people to respect 50 but if we make it a 30 we can give higher fines to get people to actually slow down', in an unfortunate majority of cases
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:09:00 - joost_schouppe: btw I had a hard time making out the difference in color between 20 and 30 in your query (I'm colorblind)
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:09:38 - timcouwelier: 20 is very much a niche thing here, and in the area I created it for it hardly ever actually touches a 30.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:10:04 - timcouwelier: which makes it less of an issue, but yea - by all means, save the query for own use and modify as you see fit.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:10:26 - joost_schouppe: uh yeah, I did :)
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:10:41 - joost_schouppe: I probably have a previous iteration of yours as well
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:10:51 - joost_schouppe: there's quite a few living streets around here
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:11:15 - timcouwelier: https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/K6B
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:11:28 - timcouwelier: that's probably the most import chunk we have as it is lol
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:11:39 - timcouwelier: but I could see the purple getting lost in a see of blues.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:11:48 - joost_schouppe: in Antwerp, if you do an identify on (for example) Frans Van Hombeeckplein, there are two segments on top of each other. One maxspeed 70 the other 30
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:12:17 - joost_schouppe: ooooh three of them :)
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:15:28 - timcouwelier: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/109761
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:15:39 - timcouwelier: :o not used to seeing those pop up.
Thu, Jun 20, 2019, 17:18:00 - joost_schouppe: so in short, Jonathan  my advice would be: a dangerous thing to share on ID. Might be suitable for JOSM users, but only with something like (warning: use on N-roads only). Interesting layers are 1/awv:afgeleide_snelheidsregimes on https://opendata.apps.mow.vlaanderen.be/opendata-geoserver/awv/wms and the single service 1/verkeersborden on http://opendata.apps.mow.vlaanderen.be/opendata-geowebcache/service/wms

Sun, Aug 18, 2019, 15:28:04 - @_oftc_Stereo:matrix.org: It says Garmin on it and goes bee-bee-beep when I start cycling
Sun, Aug 18, 2019, 15:31:12 - @gplv2:matrix.org: Since I know a thing or 2 about track and trace hardware.   It's the firmware that triggers the sample, let me put it this way, instead of having a clock trigger and save a GPS sample, you save samples based on changes in the GPS feed, distance travelled, angle change.  I'm saying that this is a simple stuff, I'm used to professional devices though.  I'm a bit biased.  It's not new though, in 2006 I designed a solution like that, still running.  I have a Garmin Etrex too since probably 2003, it's a simple receiver indeed, but attach it to a computer and with a bit of sofware, it's easy to throw away redundant points a keep a nice track based on the data of the feed.   I really hate spidering on a map if you haven't already noticed
Sun, Aug 18, 2019, 15:34:46 - @gplv2:matrix.org: to me a GPS receiver is the chip btw.   That doesn't go beepbeep
Sun, Aug 18, 2019, 16:07:25 - @_oftc_Stereo:matrix.org: I tend to configure my things to record a point as often as possible - once per second maybe. That way, I don't get cut corners.
Sun, Aug 18, 2019, 16:07:47 - @_oftc_Stereo:matrix.org: The 'smart' sampling, in my experience, cuts corners
Sun, Aug 18, 2019, 16:08:12 - @_oftc_Stereo:matrix.org: Maybe that's changed, but it's a few kb extra for each file, and that's cheap
Sun, Aug 18, 2019, 21:25:00 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I get that for 1 device it's the way to go.  I'm dealing with thousands of GPS trackers, which , if they all generated data like that, it's a lot of data to store, and this is in a database, not a file.  And most of it is useless.  vehicles stand still more time than they move.  The event based approach is quite advanced though.   Corners are fine, if you select the right angles,  I also have G-sensors, and start/stops, speed events,   And all sorts of combinations, like below 30km/h : take a sample every 5 meters, above: take a sample every 500meter (highways) etc.  But I agree if for personal use, you like to get as much as you can.  The only problem sometimes with that aproach is that GPS fixes might fail and/or be of lower quality, which makes your route (if all samples would be displayed on a map) make funny jumps.   That's something customers really don't like, although it can be explained.   Also, it's aheadache to filter out timers when a vehicle stands still, since none of the points are on the same spot due to the inaccuracy in the GPS data (deliberately).

Mon, Aug 19, 2019, 00:12:56 - @_oftc_Stereo:matrix.org: What software is that?
Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:38:05 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Looking at the posts re.  GPS trackers : would this be a good place to ask around about a better handheld walking / cycling GPS? Will start off, and play by ear. 
Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:38:25 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Currently use a Garmin Oregon 600 to collect tracklog and guide me along the intended route. One of the side buttons is broken, as is the rubber over it, so either repair at ‚Ç¨92 plus P&P or replace. 
Find two sources of inaccurate position : 1/ sideways - especially in urban canyons, but also in areas with trees and 2/ the unit's position runs behind, by like 20m in open rural areas, but up to 60m in coniferous forests. 

Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:39:00 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Enabling WAAS / EGNOS doesn't really improve things, and there's little difference between the three recording settings 'auto', 'time' and 'distance' : auto tends to add a dozen waypoints close together on some bends, but just one point on other bends - even it it happens to be the same way but in different direction, while time seems to average out the past couple of positions, number of positions used to average seems to depend on clear horizon or again coniferous forest. 

Once stationary, the unit will over the following 10 to 30 seconds show a gradually decreasing speed, but never reaches the point where I'm standing. 

Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:39:38 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: In itself, the deviation from the 'real' track can be minimised by zooming in on the map to the maximum magnification, but then the crossroads I'm at, waiting for a hint in which direction to proceed, isn't on the screen yet - frequently, the hint to turn this way or that only arrives once I'm well past the intersection, which is more than annoying : it causes the Oregon to recalculate the route, thus leading me from the intended route. The intended route being one based on filtering Mapillary to show which ways haven't been pictured in the past five, three or two years. 

Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:40:29 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: More accurate GPS would help in two ways : 3/ better accuracy when geotagging photos for Mapillary and 4/ track that's more in line with reality when improving for example winding forest paths. 

Galileo is the buzzword, understand there are two signals : the GPS L1 / Galileo E1 - which promise in the order of 3 to 5 m accuracy (but deliver errors up to 30m), and Galileo E5a which some sources promise will be better than 1m, others promise 30cm accuracy - take that with a pinch of salt, would still be a huge improvement over the current unit's 'guestimate'. 

Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:40:42 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Smartphones and tablets using the Galileo signal are listed on https://www.usegalileo.eu/EN/inner.html#data=smartphone , wearables and sport devices will be shown by picking another radio button on that page. 

Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:41:06 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Question 1 : as I'll be spending couple of hundred Euro anyhow, does 'dual frequency' mean the unit will receive and use the more accurate signal? Think it'll be a requirement, going by the graphic on https://www.gsa.europa.eu/newsroom/news/test-your-android-device-s-satellite-navigation-performance , but is dual-frequency /all/ you'll need (apart from Android 8.0 and higher)?
Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:41:32 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Question 2 : is the Galileo E1 signal in itself considerably more accurate than the GPS L1, or does one need the Galileo E5a for that? Think the answer is that you'll need E5a, as per the graphic on the above web page? 

Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:42:11 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Question 3 : have a choice between GPS receiver+data-logger , handheld GPS , and mobile phone with correct chipset and Android version to receive and make use of the accurate signal : does a mapper have experience with any of these ... ? 

Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:43:01 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: My initial choice would probably be either a unit from the Garmin GPSmap66-series, or a smartphone : chipsets are listed on https://www.usegalileo.eu/EN/inner.html#data=smartphone too, https://buy.garmin.com/nl-BE/BE/p/598408/pn/010-01918-12#specs doesn't specify the chipset, but a search for 'chipset' at google brings me to forum.gps.nl which yields 'M5 (3313)' - which isn't in the chipset list at https://buy.garmin.com/nl-BE/BE/p/598408/pn/010-01918-12#specs : 

Question 4 : if one were to have up to say ‚Ç¨5- or 600 or so available, what would be the most accurate option? An argicultural system (https://www.usegalileo.eu/EN/inner.html#data=farm) - likely to cost a bundle? A GPS datalogger (conrad.be?) - all seem rather old chipsets? A Xiaomi Mi 8 ( listprice ‚Ç¨455, sold at ‚Ç¨308, as described ca. 1/3 down the page on https://medium.com/@sjbarbeau/dual-frequency-gnss-on-android-devices-152b8826e1c)  ?  

Yours puzzled, and looking forward to any enlightenment - primarily on GPS for now, k.  
Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 13:59:03 - escada: suppose you go for the smartphone, how will you carry it ? My impression is that you loose accuracy depending on where you carry the receiver. (pocket (smartphone for me), on the chest (GPS), on the head (GoPro)). I know someone who put his Garmin on top of his hat to have the best signal (older device). Don't know whether all this trickery is still needed with recent devices.
Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 14:03:06 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Have the Oregon on the handlebar when cycling, on the strap of the day-trip backpack when walking; smartphone will have to be mounted 'in sight' when cycling to see steering hints. 
Camera used is an Olympus TG5 : waterproof up to 15m, drop-proof from 2m and can in Sports mode take rapid-fire 5 pics/sec; actioncam is an Aldi unit which gets button pressed if something interesting appears along the side of the road; both require the GPS track to geotag.
Wed, Aug 21, 2019, 14:05:44 - escada: by placing the receiver on the handlebar, it is less likely that the signal will be distorted by your body/clothing/... as in my case. Hopefully the others can give more helpful answers.
Mon, Aug 26, 2019, 01:07:42 - @koninklijke:matrix.org: Partial answer : took a 'simple' Garmin Etrex 10 as companion to the Oregon 600 this Saturday, found track more accurate, both when cycling (track on cycle lane outward journey and way back each on correct side of road, track of unmapped steps in woods much more in line with both OSM and AIV lucht than the Oregon), leaves question how to improve track in cities - would any readers have a suggestion on that, please?

Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 21:36:17 - julienfastre: ok. we are just surprized how well firefox hide your visit. We didn't register any visit from firefox browser until some of ours desactivated the anti-tracker policy for our website. But I think it must be the same for Google Analytics.
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 21:37:36 - julienfastre: with matomo, you can also upload the apache / nginx logs, which contains also a lot of information. Take care of GDPR :-)
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 21:39:35 - joost_schouppe: oh that's a little annoying of course, from a data collection perspective. I wonder if these old school trackers just using a pixel image file weren't better for simple stats
Tue, Sep 10, 2019, 09:15:24 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the pixel image should work , it's a fall back when JS is de-activated joost_schouppe  , but matomo/piwik does respect your do-not-track wish if you tell it so.

Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 17:23:15 - joost_schouppe: Anyone who understands CURL/swagger? I'm trying to get a GeoJSON with all the tasks and their status from Maproulette task 2789 , and that should be possible directlu now. But I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. More info here: https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette3/issues/914
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 18:54:04 - Jonathan: joost_schouppe: You can make the same request work!
BUT you should use HTTPS or tell cURL to "follow" the redirection between HTTP and HTTPS by adding the `-L` flag!

So:
```
curl -X GET "https://maproulette.org/api/v2/challenge/2789/tasks?limit=0" -H "accept: application/json" -H "content-type: application/json" -o "c2789.txt"
```
or
```
curl -L -X GET "http://maproulette.org/api/v2/challenge/2789/tasks?limit=0" -H "accept: application/json" -H "content-type: application/json" -o "c2789.txt"
```

I recommend using directly HTTPS :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 18:55:00 - joost_schouppe: I did that, but then I get this weird data type
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 18:55:21 - joost_schouppe: And apparently, you can get it straight to geojson now
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 18:56:24 - Jonathan: Oh okay, I didn't get that you were trying to get GeoJSON instead of the "default" JSON.
Sorry ; I'll have a look !
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 18:58:07 - Jonathan: I think this is it :
```
curl -X GET "https://maproulette.org/api/v2/challenge/view/2789" -H "accept: application/json" -H "content-type: application/json" -o "c2789.txt"
```
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 18:58:09 - joost_schouppe: Apparently that's a new feature
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 18:59:08 - Jonathan: And you can add `status`, `reviewStatus`, or `priority` to filter (details on the values for those parameters here : https://maproulette.org/docs/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/assets/swagger.json#/Challenge/getChallengeGeoJSON)
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 19:00:41 - Jonathan: For instance:
```
curl -X GET "https://maproulette.org/api/v2/challenge/view/2789?status=1" -H "accept: application/json" -H "content-type: application/json" -o "c2789.txt"
```
will return only the `status = fixed`
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 19:01:31 - Jonathan: I also would suggest to change `-o "c2789.txt"` to something like `-o "c2789.geojson"` :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 19:02:07 - joost_schouppe: yeah, that'd make sense :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 19:02:39 - Jonathan: It doesn't matter though, it's just the resulting filename on your disk.
Fri, Oct 4, 2019, 19:03:32 - joost_schouppe: this is completely awesome

Extra feature needed: it should show you the total area of the polygon after each click, because the result needs to be close to 1 km2.
Mon, Nov 4, 2019, 18:09:01 - joost_schouppe: It's for a project Maell (from osgeo) was asked for help with, and they have a whole workflow in Google Earth

Yes, it does. Top right corner of the map.

Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 09:49:11 - s8evq: Maybe two small questions for the dev group: We have a colaboration going on with Grote Routepaden VZW in which both of us work together to get a GR walking route 100% correct in OSM. We have now worked together and complete one GR (GR 131) already. Now my question. 
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 09:49:48 - s8evq: Joost suggested to save the the route as GPX and OSM. For the OSM part, I assume this is possible in JOSM: load the route and press "save as", nothing more to it?
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 09:50:08 - s8evq: This would make sure we have a copy of the route and saveguard it from vandalism
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 09:50:30 - s8evq: Secondly: we would need to monitor the route for accidental damage. 
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 09:51:30 - s8evq: Does somebody know existing scripts for that? Now I run a weekly script that checks the status of the relation in http://ra.osmsurround.org/. Does anybody know of another workflow to monitor changes / damages in an finished relation?
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 10:12:54 - juminet: Hello s8evq . You could also use the 'diff' keyword in a overpass query. Look at this example: https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/OsF. You can change the dates in the "diff" keyword. Look at the results in the map and data tab. The results are not really easy to interpret, though, but the query might be improved to only show some changes... 
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 10:13:32 - juminet: BTW I didn't know about http://ra.osmsurround.org/ but it does not seem to work right now.
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 10:16:24 - escada: there used to be a download button on the routes listed on https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Belgium/Walking_Routes
Did the template change, or was the link accidentally removed ?
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 10:17:08 - escada: GPX can still be downloaded from https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 10:21:57 - s8evq: escada: I'm not sure about the download button. I don't remember every seeing that on that page.
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 10:22:18 - s8evq: Thanks juminet I will have a look and investigate. I was not aware of the diff keyword.
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 10:23:02 - s8evq: ra.osmsurround.org seems to be down indeed. One more reason to do a direct overpass query instead of depending on an external tool :)
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 10:24:22 - escada: the link to the relation used to have alternatives, a.o a GPX download.
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 11:01:59 - s8evq: What I would like is something that would show a visual representation like achavi and osmcha, but only for one specific relation.
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 11:02:25 - s8evq: I'll see if I can come close with overpass api and diff
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 12:41:54 - lionel_giard: If you find anything better than overpass for that, I would be interested as I'm monitoring some relation and only looking via overpass at the moment. :/
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 12:45:18 - s8evq: lionel_giard: What is your overpass query you use?
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 12:47:24 - s8evq: Now I'm struggeling a bit with Overpass. I like the diff option, that works great, but  i would like to overlay it with a query that shows the complete relation as it was. Using then mapcss `Style {{ }}` to give those two a different colour. I don't manage to get that.
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 12:59:40 - s8evq: If only I could put both these queries on one map: https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/Ot5 and https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/Ot6
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 13:00:12 - s8evq: The difference is the first line, the settings: `diff` instead of `date`. But overpass only allows declaring the settings once.
Tue, Nov 26, 2019, 14:12:27 - lionel_giard: I just query the items that I want to check and that were modified and quickly run a manual check on josm (exporting it from overpass) as I both check tags and geometry of some elements (but these are very rarely edited apparently, which make it possible to check like that). Ex: I check the UNESCO and heritage tags of various object in wallonia, also some geometry of castles... :-)

Thu, Dec 19, 2019, 21:34:24 - @gplv2:matrix.org: mmm...  there's more than 1 way in unix, that's for sure.  But sort -u is much more effective than uniq. pietervdvn , you're contradicting yourself here.  why use a flag of there is already a tool doing the same.   Makes no sense.  Why not leveraging a single command ?   it's comparing apples to lemons.    There is a single tool doing everything in 1 pass.    it's not a flag, it's a tool by itself.  You can as well write :  cat blah.txt | sort  | sort -u   instead of cat blah.txt | sort | uniq.   you should also take a look at the man pages for this:
Thu, Dec 19, 2019, 21:34:25 - @gplv2:matrix.org: Note: 'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they  are  adjacent.
       You  may want to sort the input first, or use 'sort -u' without 'uniq'.
       Also, comparisons honor the rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.

Thu, Dec 19, 2019, 21:34:44 - @gplv2:matrix.org: even the man page of uniq says to use sort -u ;-)
Thu, Dec 19, 2019, 23:55:12 - pietervdvn: no, the point is that the bash language offers primitives, one primitive which sorts, one primitive which does the uniq thingy. I prefer that over memorizing all the possible flags of sort and how they might or might not interfere

Secondly,  that's what the man pages are for.  -u(nique) isn't THAT hard to remember is it ;-) .  point is they don't do the same thing...   sort -u <> uniqe   .   It's untapped power not using parameters to commands.   There is not such thing as 'on the side'.  A tool is almost never made to do just one thing.

Do you know a plugin/tool/package/method/...  where it is possible to create an origin-destination table between addresses on a road network, but only with adjacent adresses point on the network (like on a street, adress A would get the origin-destination with distance calculated only for adress B and C that are its direct neighbour, but not D which is on the other side of C üòÅ) ? I don't want to calculate all the origin-destination between all my addresses (as it is obviously very long). I really don't know much about this, and i don't want to do routing afterwards, only creating this origin-destination table with spatial data (from adress points along streets lines). :-) 
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 12:13:11 - timcouwelier: I'm not sure I understand what you want to do?
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 12:24:14 - joost_schouppe: So you only want the left and right neighbor, nothing else?
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 12:36:25 - lionel_giard: I'll explain with a (beautiful) paint graph : on the graph below, I have a series of adresses nodes (A to E) and street lines. I want an origin destination table (+ distance along the network) between each adress node and their adjacent (neighbour) adress on the network. So, B and C are adjacent to A, but D and E are not. While for node C, it is now A, D and E that are the adjacent node on the network. I don't need the origin destination pair between A and D for example (as in my processing afterwards, i only want to look at the direct neighbour and how far it is on the network). But i don't know of any origin-destination calculation that allow me to only calculate for the adjacent node on the network.

Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 12:39:19 - lionel_giard: (i didn't do for D and E but that's the idea :p)
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 12:42:48 - timcouwelier: So you want each adress projected on the nearest highway, then cover the geometric distance along the highways between each two 'adjacent' projected points, to convert it in a graph
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 12:43:07 - timcouwelier: on which you can afterwards solve shortest routes using something like Dijkstra's algorithm?

Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 12:52:33 - timcouwelier: This is what you want to get as simplication, use that as a graph, and then figure out all 'weights' for the distances between two adjacent points, and use those weights as input for a shortest path algorithm between each two points?
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 12:55:57 - timcouwelier: Might be tricky if your source data (in case of say OSM) has extra nodes in between for roads that are clipped for say speed limit differences or name changes, ideally you'd merge all two-way connections that are not on a named node. 3+ connected ways seems to be needing a seperate node in your graph, creating extra branches

Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 13:06:53 - timcouwelier: english version ^^
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 13:09:10 - lionel_giard: Yeah that's the plugin i used, but it calculate all the origin destination (not only the adjacent one) and i didn't find an option to restrict it to the adjacent only. When i have 30k address point, it is 30.000 * 30.000 origin-destination. :D 
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 13:14:56 - lionel_giard: Technically, i think that what i want is to check the adjacency and then only calculate network distance on this adjacency list. And if i read well, that kind of function exist in PostGIS (but i don't have access to that thanks to corporate policy :D). That's why i'm digging all other tools that i have access to (QGIS, R, ...) but i didn't find it yet. Most people work with origin destination that are already created, but don't explain how they create it. :p 
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 13:15:21 - timcouwelier: Just thinking if applying some kind of 'nearest neighbour analysis' is helpfull here
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 13:16:10 - timcouwelier: but that doesn't seem quite helpful - was hoping it'd help you define the adjacency..
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 13:18:12 - timcouwelier: or if pgr_dijkstra from the pgrouting tool (postgis) works
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 13:18:42 - lionel_giard: It is super easy to do adjacency list when things touch each other (like for roads, polygons...) but i don't know how to do it on a network without postgis. :p 
Thu, Mar 19, 2020, 13:19:09 - timcouwelier: oh right, no postgis.

Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:13:29 - @_oftc_loophp:matrix.org: Hello all,
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:14:09 - @_oftc_loophp:matrix.org: I'm experimenting a bit with the OSM API and I was wondering in which measure it would be possible to generate diffs (just like a regular git diff) in between each changesets.
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:23:19 - juminet: Hello. The OSM API is still obscure for me, but I know there are some diffs files available for updating, eg, tile servers. But I don't know in which extent it is "git-like". Another thing is the augmented diff from the overpass API: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Augmented_Diffs With the latter, you can do actually a lot!
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:26:44 - juminet: Related doc for using with overpass-turbo: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Augmented_Delta_between_two_dates_.28.22adiff.22.29
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:28:44 - @_oftc_loophp:matrix.org: I will check it out.
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:33:47 - escada: loophp: I don't understand what you want to achieve. I know git diff. You have 2 text files from different submits and want to see the differences.
Here you will need 2 database dumps and compare those.  The OSM API is not suited for that. The Augmented Diffs from Overpass uses a optimized DB to get such results..

But if you want to look at the effects of a changeset, isn't it enough to retrieve that changeset?
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:34:48 - @_oftc_loophp:matrix.org: Not necessarily, check the discussion in #osm. Basically what I just need is the previous version of an element. That's it.
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:37:12 - escada: so the thing that is returned for https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1942437110/history (but as object, not HTML)
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:38:35 - escada: And how does that help you for the discussion in #osm?
The version of a way is not bumped when the coords of one of its nodes are changed
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:40:37 - escada: A way's version changes when its attributes change or when nodes are added/removed.
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:43:19 - escada: Your question was "is it possible to see what changed"?
yes: that is the content of the changeset.
but when there is a bunch of nodes in that changeset, you do not have a lot of context by looking at the text alone.
you might see that node such or such was moved. But you won't know which ways are impacted by that. (if any).
Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 12:44:38 - @_oftc_loophp:matrix.org: Ooh ... interesting.

Thu, Apr 30, 2020, 13:35:20 - vmarc: In knooppuntnet I have provided changeset pages, like for example: https://knooppuntnet.nl/en/changeset/84259911/3997370. This is limited to changes that have an impact on nodenetworks only though, and do require login via your OSM account.

I have downloaded the GPX files, have made the MD5sums of them. Once a month, I would redownload the GPX files, recalculate the MD5sum, and see where it differs. Then I know which one has been changed. I got so far and that's working fine.

Wed, Oct 21, 2020, 19:27:05 - joost_schouppe: In crab komt in principe enkel wat in een gemeenteraadbesluit is goedgekeurd. Lijkt me dus waarschijnlijker dat ze de bordjes ooit aanpassen, dan dat ze een offici√´le adreswijziging gaan doen

Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 12:19:36 - joost_schouppe: Am I right that TMS is faster than WMTS? Because I hear that WMTS is "more advanced" than TMS
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 13:36:10 - timcouwelier: Not sure if there's a speed difference
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 13:36:19 - timcouwelier: In fact, I'm not sure if I use a TMS for anything
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 13:36:46 - timcouwelier: XYZ seems the more common option for serving tiles
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 13:37:43 - timcouwelier: and I think (but note I'm no expert) WMTS has an advantage over WMS when it comes to caching tiles, which matters a lot if panning around a lot, only have to request the non-cached tiles instead of the whole thing again.
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 13:38:20 - timcouwelier: In GIS, I mostly go for the WMS, but set Qgis to request it only in 512x512 pixel tiles, in case I need large areas at once
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:49:19 - Jonathan: No, not really.
Standard used has nothing to do with the speed. :)

TMS is similar to XYZ (the way OSM tiles are served) : each tile has a coordinate (X, Y, Zoom Level) and an url point to each individual tile (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map)

WMTS is "between" TMS/XYZ and WMS.
You can request the WMTS service to give you the list of layers available, query the objects, ... (all of those are not provided by TMS/XYZ) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service).
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:50:42 - Jonathan: Different technologies for different usage.
If you only need to server a baselayer (like OSM do), go for TMS/XYZ.
If you need a more complex service with layers, queries, ... go for WMTS/WMS.
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:51:33 - Jonathan: Speed is (mostly) only a matter of pre-rendered (or cached) tiles.
And it's possible with WMS, WMTS, TMS, and XYZ.
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:51:46 - joost_schouppe: ah, makes sense
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:52:10 - joost_schouppe: so it is really logical that basemaps are much more often in TMS than WMTS, as you don't need advanced features there
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:52:18 - Jonathan: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "so it is really logical that bas..."> Yep :)
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:52:39 - joost_schouppe: so it's not like WMTS is going to replace TMS
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:52:48 - Jonathan: Nope, different usage :)
Wed, Dec 16, 2020, 14:55:00 - joost_schouppe: ok, merci!

Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:28:32 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: it's due to CSP policy, i'll have to tweak that
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:28:52 - pietervdvn: oh, right
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:29:26 - pietervdvn: also, it seems like the CSS is not getting through

Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:56:59 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: pietervdvn, hmmm, issues:
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:57:13 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: the custom HTML pages like aed.html are not generated in dist/ by `npm run build`
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:57:35 - pietervdvn: that's weird
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:57:44 - pietervdvn: also: overpass is blocked on your instance
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:58:07 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: and the customGenerator.html doesn't declare it's charset, so the server must be configured to UTF-8 (which is not in line with the "easy to deploy" design goal)
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 18:59:49 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: and it also tries to fetch https://pietervdvn.github.io/latlon2country//0.0.0.json

Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 19:01:05 - pietervdvn: it has all the boundaries, it is used to determine the country of a shop
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 19:01:22 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: hm, would be nice to host that too
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 19:02:18 - pietervdvn: you can fetch all the tiles on my github pages and host it, you can change the link here: https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete/blob/62b52834875a9d7563b2e61daa445357447d5b88/Logic/MetaTagging.ts#L66
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 19:02:31 - pietervdvn: just put in your own host and your ready to go
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 19:03:30 - pietervdvn: I get that you block imgur, but maybe unblock wikimedia and mangrove.reviews? A lot of the icons for custom themes are hosted on wikimedia
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 19:04:31 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: yes, i'm going to :) but it's a whitelist
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 19:06:42 - pietervdvn: allready thought so
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:14:08 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: pietervdvn, the aed.html (and such) did get generated if i run `npm run prepare-deploy`
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:14:26 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: so that's something
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:15:04 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: probably `npm run generate:layouts` ?
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:17:04 - pietervdvn: right!
Indeed, generate:layouts does that
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:17:34 - pietervdvn: I deploy with `npm run deploy:production`; check the 'scripts'-section in package.json to see the inner machinery of that
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:19:38 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: yes, i got my inspiration from there
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:20:13 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: of course that deploy:production is only applicable on your machine so i dived right into what's *in* the onliner
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:30:22 - pietervdvn: indeed
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:35:03 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: most stuff that i want to work should be working by now.
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:35:39 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: btw, you link maps.me in the description, you may want to reconsider your endorsment now that they're sold and destroying their application
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:37:33 - @_oftc_midgard:matrix.org: i like the "deze straat wordt binnenkort een fietsstraat!"
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 23:35:28 - pietervdvn: <@_oftc_midgard:matrix.org "btw, you link maps.me in the des..."> Oh, right. Yeah, I guess a libre alternative'll be popping up soon

Fri, Apr 16, 2021, 12:28:00 - MikiDi: With the acquisition of Mapillary by FB in mind, I have been thinking if an approach with (at least) decentralized file-storage would be a good fit for this kind of application (IPFS is what I know best). To my surprise, there is very little information to be found on this topic. This https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?id=53130 is the only place I could find where some aspects of such an approach are discussed. Since I wasn't that much in the loop at the time of the acquisition, I haven't followed discussions at the time they happened. Now, almost a year later, it's not very clear to me what is happening in the OSM-community regarding new developments/ alternatives for street-level imagery-platforms. Any pointers or own insights on this topic would be much appreciated :-)

Wed, May 12, 2021, 14:45:24 - timcouwelier: maybe starting with like 5% of flanders in shown bbox, letting that finish, pan sideways a bit to get another chunk to load, etc.. might cut down on the size of the requests in one go?
Wed, May 12, 2021, 14:46:09 - timcouwelier: we'd need a WFS-splitter like you can set tile sizes for WMS data, to request smaller chunks lol

Once the hiking.osm.be subdomain is set, they will connect the landing page presenting the paper maps to it.

aan mij
Hey Joost,

Mijn laatste contact met hen was ongeveer een jaar geleden. Ik zie dat voornamelijk Natasha Blommaert (co√∂rdinator bij AWV) het woord nam, maar ik heb ook meerdere mensen van bij MOW in die mail staan. Ik ga ervan uit dat dit voldoende mensen zullen zijn. Ik zal die mail vanavond proberen op te sturen.

In bijlage kan je het Java-project vinden dat ik vorig jaar geschreven heb om de data te exporteren. Het script gaat in blokken van 5 bij 5 kilometer alle verkeersborden in Vlaanderen binnenhalen en doet aan een paginering per 10000 verkeersborden in dat blok. Vooral de klasse FeatureGetter bevat die logica. Het zet de features dan om in een tab-separated bestand, wat voor ons toen het handigste was omdat we de borden in een gedeelde spreadsheet gingen onderzoeken. Omdat we voor het project slechts naar enkele gemeenten moesten kijken, wordt er ook een apart bestand aangemaakt met de verkeersborden binnen het grondgebied van die gemeenten (vandaar het gemeenten.geojson bestand in main/resources). Ook heb ik een lijst van verkeersborden in het project staan (SimpleFeatureUtils) om op te filteren. Dat was nodig omdat we voor het project alleen gekeken hebben naar verkeersborden die de snelheid be√Ønvloeden.

Thu, Nov 18, 2021, 15:30:34 - julienfastre: Kind of git dark magic...

Thu, Nov 18, 2021, 15:42:28 - julienfastre: no, but i think you can clone it and the push to the new repository
Thu, Nov 18, 2021, 15:44:16 - julienfastre: ```
git clone https://gitea.champs-libres.be/julienfastre/traffic-sign-project.git
# create the new github repo and copy the git link
git remote set-url origin <-- the git link here
git push -u origin master
```

Fri, Dec 10, 2021, 14:25:39 - joost_schouppe: Slightly off topic probably, but do you know anyone who can tell a good story about the wonderful world of Python? We'd like to use it as a common language for relatively simple and infrequent ETL data processing (we now use SAS, SPSS and Excel). And as a bridge to making pretty things, mostly for data exploration. Or perhaps a little machine learning as well. Right now, we're doing a course, but it's really dry -- and many people don't see the point because doing in three hours what takes 30 seconds in Excel isn't exaclty motivating. So it really is about the bigger picture. Or perhaps if you know a good video or channel, that would also work!

Verify with https://grbosm.site when it's in maintenance mode , I'm working on the production data.   But since MapComplete just uses the data It's not reflected there.  I'll build in an error message with the proper http response so Pieter can anticipate and build some sort of exception to cleanly handle that soon

Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 17:51:08 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I've been thinking about the Urbis version problem.  Since the version wasn't backreferenced but ref:urbis is , the diff will always show every building in BXL because it's lacking the source:geometry:* refs.   But looking at BXL, it's still pretty accurate, the address data is a bit problematic since a lot of AssociatedStreet relations have been used and also address points.   Even a small area is just tons of manual work.

I think we can solve this partially by adding a version=1 to all those Urbis buildings and/or if the version is lacking, assuming it's version=1 (still debating about that ).   If I modify the code to also support ref:urbis next to source:geometry:ref , I think I can make the tool better (=more useful).  Even though I see a lot of ref:urbis that do not match up anymore to the current Urbis exports, I think we can use that fact in the filter to point that out and let mappers decide what to do by not filtering those out  So I just need an extra test for the existance of the version reference, compair that with the version in Urbis database and like that get a more filtered export that is actually manageable. 

I tried doing a little part of brussels in the tool and it's just so many geometries, about a 1000 warnings for a small area, and also hard to merge geometries since they are so packed together and a lot of the times are exactly the same , so it's hard to select them.  I think for BXL since they did a flat import there, it's a better approach to improve OSM data. 
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:23:27 - joost_schouppe: In that case it might be better to do a geometric analysis of "probably outdated buildings". Perhaps also taking in account the age of the osm building, not to have false positives where osm is more up to date
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:32:11 - @gplv2:matrix.org: been thinking about that too
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:32:42 - @gplv2:matrix.org: but that's harder
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:33:01 - @gplv2:matrix.org: there are some things to consider there.
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:33:30 - joost_schouppe: MapComplete already has a sort of logic for that 
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:33:38 - @gplv2:matrix.org: minute differences in position, cleanup and normalizing will cause non-exact matches.  the exact matches are easy
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:34:05 - @gplv2:matrix.org: yes, we use the same libraries, but mapcomplete doesn't do that for an area, it does it per building
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:34:25 - @gplv2:matrix.org: (afaik)
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:35:15 - @gplv2:matrix.org: and it uses raw data, not the data the post-processed data where I fix tons of issues.  It's ok for a per-building basis, but grbtool is not about per building
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:36:40 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the problem with urbis is also:  they use the address points a lot,  there are so many variables at play here and it's probably because I'm so familiar with the data (and problems) that I see issues in every approach
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:37:14 - @gplv2:matrix.org: the question becomes too : Do we want to migrate towards addresses on buildings for BXL
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:38:43 - @gplv2:matrix.org: It happens the geometries in the source isn't right
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:39:33 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I don't want to make a single source authorative, the intention has always been to make a better from 2 , or 3 ... or more
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:40:14 - @gplv2:matrix.org: it's also a reason why DWG isn't a big fan of imports as-is
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:40:30 - @gplv2:matrix.org: and I aggree after seeing what I saw
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:40:47 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I constantly delete addresses from buildings in Picc
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:41:37 - @gplv2:matrix.org: bacause they are duplicated on the next building, I believe it's because Picc adddresses are also put on building parts, e.g . GRB Roof, verdieping
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:42:08 - @gplv2:matrix.org: so when I see warnings in Josm I take a real good look and I remove it from 1 part
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:42:47 - @gplv2:matrix.org: mapcomplete certainly has it's use, but it's not really 'seeing' the whole picture you do see in JOSM.
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:44:02 - @gplv2:matrix.org: I'm afraid that a lot of the times , buildings will be put on the map that have issues.   I've already seen 2 spelling errors in the street names
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:44:14 - @gplv2:matrix.org: hence also on the buildings.
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:44:42 - @gplv2:matrix.org: in JOSM you get a warning that there is a discrepancy between the road name and the building addr:street tag
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:49:15 - @gplv2:matrix.org: Picc also uses diffent geometries for that 'roof', 'verdieping' equivalent in GRB, but problem there is that they don't detail further , and now in 'my' database, they are also building=house  , and I think it would have been better to have made them building=yes.   But In a next data processing import I can address that part.
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:50:14 - @gplv2:matrix.org: this is causes by them being addressed ( put the address on the building process does that from picc data)
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:53:21 - @gplv2:matrix.org: for a solution for Urbis, I'm thinking like this:
- no version ref on source -> assume version 1 and compare to real version , they start with 1
- ref:UrbIS key present, but no source:geometry:ref in OSM -> use that one to compare to GRBTool source:geometry:ref
- do spatial analysis and see if the difference cross a certain threshold.  Minute diffs will not trigger the filter

Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:54:41 - @gplv2:matrix.org: like this: all the buildings that differ a lot, both in meta and in geometry will not be filtered out and sent to JOSM
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 18:56:19 - @gplv2:matrix.org: in the end: I'll reuse the ref:UrbIS backref (which is actually good they decided to include this), I don't have to update every occurance of this key and add version=1 .  This lays down a good baseline for the tool.
Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 19:00:33 - @gplv2:matrix.org: In any case, Picc/GRB data output is looking great at the moment.  I tested a lot of blank area's and also a lot of already populated (buildings I've drawn myself ) and the outcome is really on point, exactly what we want to see. I solved the border problems using the OSM administrative boundaries.   But for Urbis, I feel like I need to make it better

I've dropped about 3 GB worth in indexes that weren't used, and I set all empty fields to NULL so the indexes are more optimal.  I'm thinking of doubling the performance of that server as well so the DB can be put entirely in memory.  but I also would like to upgrade postgres , it's using 9.6 version now, it's a bit of an older installation. The duplicates there will be served from redis nevertheless.

Mon, Jan 10, 2022, 19:21:10 - @gplv2:matrix.org: from what I see flying by, It seems there is a bug in one of the 3rd party libraries you use.  and something I noticed over the years of messing with console.log : if you send it too much too fast, the browser will max out the cpu.   you can calculate 1000 geometries and it will be fine, but sending 1000 messages to console.log and that's like : wow... lots of printing work ;-)

I think that it's some sort of a mass import/merge.  These people are not occupied by normalised data, by re-usability of data, by having decent timestamps and so on.   There is a version update field in the database that is free text and not a date, and often you see some sort of a mention in text of the method / process / task that was used to enter in in Urbis, that's why I think the data model is inferior to Picc/Grb, atleast they understand that having a date something was update is pretty damn useful

Everything before version 6 I can explain: that's the stuff that hasn't been measured/update/changed in a long time.  Everything after version 6 are things they did measure, rebuilt , changed and so on.  The only discrepancy here is that logically we should see a better spread between versions.   need to think of the social aspect too.   Increased interest in geospatial data the more years passed by since the start, digitalisation at one point in time. lots of things play here I guess.  But in essence, it's not that important I think.   Not everything is working against getting this sorted out.  Some fact play in favor of a decent solution.
Tue, Jan 11, 2022, 18:12:37 - @gplv2:matrix.org: and on top:  the question is : what do we want to achieve.   for Brussels since it's imported a while back, it's the differences, how it modified.  For Picc most of the work is just import to finally put houses on the map where it's so empty, and also keep track of what is done.  For GRB it's often to complete places, update address data (or fix).  the primary goals differ per region.  
Tue, Jan 11, 2022, 18:17:56 - @gplv2:matrix.org: having ref:UrbIS in OSM is actually more useful than I first thought.   I can work with it.   I just need to filter (=keep) the things that aren't lining up for Urbis, both metadata and gespatial.  this is not a problem in GRB/Picc once we have our references in the database,  mappers can , should even fix things that aren't looking correct (attaching buildings, ignoring GRB/Picc/URbis address information).  All sorts of things that aren't ok in the source, that is why a mapper is needed that thinks , validates, fixes.   I just spent half hour fixing someones landuse stuff, omg.  attaching it to buildings, to roads.  so annoying....

There are some exclusions needed :   `UPDATE planet_osm_polygon SET "addr:street" = upper(left("addr:street", 1)) || right("addr:street", -1) WHERE "addr:street" is not null AND "addr:street" <> upper(left("addr:street", 1)) || right("addr:street", -1) AND "addr:street" NOT IN ('von Asten-Stra√üe','von-Dhaem-Strasse','von-Montigny-Stra√üe','von-Orley-Stra√üe','t Zand','be-MINE') AND position('''' IN "addr:street") <> 2;`

If you're interested, ping me and I'll give you all the details.
Work can start ASAP! No freelance work though.
You'll have the "pleasure" to work with me on a really exciting project. üòÑ
Tue, May 3, 2022, 12:14:45 - joost_schouppe: Some colleagues of mine built a process on top of raw XML data that they manually extract from BBBike. However, we are expanding it a bit and would like a similar file for an area that‚Äôs a bit larger: basically https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/53134 , but including the gap of Brussels and with a buffer around it of about 30 km (we can provide a geojson of the area). We would need an update of the file only every couple of months. Anyone willing to do this for a fee?
Tue, May 3, 2022, 13:35:35 - MikiDi: Not entirely clear on the "raw XML-data they manually extract from BBBike". You mean a manually defined bounding box on https://extract.bbbike.org/ yielding OSM XML?
Tue, May 3, 2022, 14:04:30 - joost_schouppe: yep
Tue, May 3, 2022, 14:05:24 - joost_schouppe: they also tried with the XML for Belgium that you can download at Geofabrik, but it has too much data (Wallonia) and too little data (wider buffer around Flanders needed)
Tue, May 3, 2022, 14:22:42 - MikiDi: More and more I'm now wondering if this bbbike export is something special (bike-oriented subset of osm data) or just a tool for making extracts üôÉ
Tue, May 3, 2022, 14:45:01 - joost_schouppe: it is just an extract I think
Tue, May 3, 2022, 14:50:52 - joost_schouppe: I just downloaded a tiny subset. It's just "all osm data"
Tue, May 3, 2022, 16:16:10 - Jonathan: As discussed last week I would start for Geofabriek extract and use tools like osmosis to do that.
Tue, May 3, 2022, 16:18:45 - joost_schouppe: Yep, but apparently it's too much hassle for us. So basically I'm looking for someone to push that button and charge us for it
Tue, May 3, 2022, 16:19:58 - joost_schouppe: It might make sense to zoom out and look at our whole setup for this project, but I'd rather first see if people actually use the tool

Sat, Jun 25, 2022, 18:32:36 - joost_schouppe: I'd like to make an anitmated map of Mapillary coverage. I managed (took me an hour!) to add Mapillary vecotr tiles in QGIS, but styling them is a whole other hassle. Is there a way to simply export vector tiles to a file format I'm more used to working with (geopackage, geojson)?
Sat, Jun 25, 2022, 19:48:24 - Thibaultmol: I don't know if this is anything.
https://github.com/tobesucht/mapillary_downloader
I found this repo last month, which claims to be compatible with the newest mapillary api version. But I couldn't get any of it to work
Sat, Jun 25, 2022, 19:51:10 - Thibaultmol: There's also osmand's implementation you can look into https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/plugins/mapillary/MapillaryPlugin.java

Again, I don't know if any of these resources are useful, but I'm just posting them here
Sat, Jun 25, 2022, 19:55:28 - Thibaultmol: for Qgis there is https://github.com/enricofer/go2mapillary but it's unmaintained and not compatible with v4 api


Sat, Jun 25, 2022, 19:55:34 - Thibaultmol: Can't you just use these though?
https://www.mapillary.com/developer/tiles-documentation/
Sat, Jun 25, 2022, 19:58:11 - joost_schouppe: Yep, that last thing is what I used. The thing is, the "just using them" is an issue. I don't know the first thing about styling vector data, but if I can convert it to a more "regular GIS" format, I'll have the maps I need in absolutely no time
Sat, Jun 25, 2022, 20:09:46 - Thibaultmol: Guess this mapbox repo doesn't work anymore either? https://github.com/mapbox/vt2geojson

Tue, Jun 28, 2022, 08:35:59 - Thibaultmol: last update is a while ago
Tue, Jun 28, 2022, 08:36:55 - Thibaultmol: If none of this end up not working. I guess maybe it's time to learn how to work with vector tiles? XD
Tue, Jun 28, 2022, 08:43:02 - joost_schouppe: giving it a try. The dependencies are killing me of course
Tue, Jun 28, 2022, 08:47:57 - joost_schouppe: ahh it's always shit to install on a pc you're no admin of. I need node.js , but the direct install needs admin rights; the command line install requires some stuff that's beyong me

For some reason, the correct URL for WMTS is `https://geo.api.vlaanderen.be/HISTCART` (with uppercase `HISTCART`) but you've put it with lowercase in the configuration file.

I did a bit of research yesterday, but best I could find is https://www.terrestris.de/en/hoehenmodell-srtm30-wms/ , which is slow and has an embbeded QR code. I like the altitude lines in opentopomap, but I couldn't find a stand alone version of that. Though https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap/blob/master/vector/opentopomap.json#L53 seems to refer to a separate layer one could load.
Tue, Dec 5, 2023, 09:50:39 - joost_schouppe: well to answer my own question... That link refers to MapTiler and there you have a mapbox studio kind of interface where you can strip down a topo map to just altitude info :)
