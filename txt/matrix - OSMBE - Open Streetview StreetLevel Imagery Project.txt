Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:16:10 - xivk joined the room
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:16:47 - joost_schouppe: See the room subject for an outline of ideas to discuss with Mapillary, next Monday
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:16:50 - Jonathan joined the room
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:17:23 - joost_schouppe: Purpose of this group is to make sure an open solution is found for the gap left by AIV stopping their street-level imagery collection
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:21:53 - timcouwelier joined the room
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:24:46 - joost_schouppe: Now why is this thing not in my "gesprekken"?
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:25:09 - joost_schouppe: oh a refresh did the trick
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:58:00 - timcouwelier: Got internal planning meeting - depending on bosses mood I may see if I can somehow join in the chat during work hours
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:58:07 - timcouwelier: but wouldn't hold my breath on it.
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 18:58:25 - timcouwelier: (think I've covered most of my concerns either in chat to Joost or in the hackmd though)
Thu, Jun 27, 2019, 21:05:23 - Seppe joined the room
Fri, Jun 28, 2019, 10:00:10 - Jonathan: I didn't go through the whole document but I'll do that this weekend!
Looks really interesting :)
Sun, Jun 30, 2019, 23:02:57 - Seppe: "Bigger municipalities have big budgets and do need very high quality and GIS-people approved solutions"

I don't really understand that sentence
Sun, Jun 30, 2019, 23:04:29 - joost_schouppe: Eh, so thinking of Ghent, where you have a GIS department that can actually offer decent tools to people. They will probably be less willing to promote solutions that are "less professional"
Sun, Jun 30, 2019, 23:05:18 - joost_schouppe: While in a small town, people are used to improvising and don't have much gis support
Sun, Jun 30, 2019, 23:10:58 - Seppe: I understand your explanation, but not the sentence on the hackpad. I'm reading: "Bigger municipalities do not need high quality solutions", while I would say they do.
Sun, Jun 30, 2019, 23:11:35 - joost_schouppe: Uh I don't know where you get that "not" from
Sun, Jun 30, 2019, 23:16:37 - Seppe: omg, holiday dementia is creeping in I'm afraid
sorry about that ...
Sun, Jun 30, 2019, 23:25:02 - Seppe: Would this be an option for preprocessing (especially blurring) before putting the images open and uploading them to Mapillary? https://amsterdam.github.io/projects/open-panorama/
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 07:34:20 - joost_schouppe: ^^ in your defence, it is an overly complex sentence
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 07:34:39 - joost_schouppe: Looks interesting, but not simple
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 09:43:53 - timcouwelier: Sadly, won't be able to make it for the call session.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 09:44:16 - timcouwelier: However, I may be able to keep an eye on here, so if there's questions you need my input for - I'll try and answer
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 09:57:20 - Seppe: I'm ready
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 09:57:38 - joost_schouppe: can't see you though
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 09:58:18 - joost_schouppe: of zit jij op de hangouts?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 09:58:33 - joost_schouppe: verwarrend vergaderverzoek; zit een hangouts √©n een jitsi in
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 09:59:19 - Seppe: waar moet ik zitten?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 09:59:36 - joost_schouppe: geen idee, alletwee is leeg op dit moment :)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:12:19 - timcouwelier: opgelost, of zitten jullie nog steeds te wachten?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:13:37 - joost_schouppe: we zitten op jitsi, mooi op tijd beginnen
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:23:50 - Seppe: "pretty sure" uhu ...
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:24:55 - Seppe: niet zeker of ze de licentie echt goed kent
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:25:07 - Seppe: of wij hebben ze te strikt ge√Ønterpreteerd ...
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:27:09 - timcouwelier sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:27:17 - timcouwelier: da's de 'SA'-nuance, toch?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:27:41 - timcouwelier: en da's een flink verschil...
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:28:11 - joost_schouppe: haar uitleg staat een beetje los van "gewoon website gebruik"
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:28:27 - joost_schouppe: ik ben aan het begin van de hackpad wat nota's aan het nemen ook h√©
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:29:18 - timcouwelier: had ik willen merken (kreeg melding van edits), ik lees effe bij
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:29:23 - Seppe: üëç
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:37:02 - Seppe: "3d reconstruction of the world" looks pretty cool
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:39:15 - joost_schouppe: ik ben mij aan 't inhouden om ze niet op te jagen :)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:39:47 - Seppe: Message deleted
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:39:50 - Seppe: :-)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:40:40 - Seppe: Ik voeg straks ook nog notities toe
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:44:39 - joost_schouppe: ziet er als "detections" uit voor mij:

Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:48:12 - timcouwelier sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:48:49 - timcouwelier: met die 'detections' via hun eigen site kan je zien waar/uit welke afbeelding de detectie volgt
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:48:57 - Seppe: ziet er als "detections" uit voor mij:
ja, zat ook zo in mijn hoofd
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:49:17 - Seppe: als ze van alles twee foto's moeten hebben, dan zouden we niet veel zien denk ik
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:50:05 - timcouwelier: weet niet of er overal twee zijn hier, maar random wat punten gekozen.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:50:16 - timcouwelier: tenzij ze dat daar melden, al vast dat voor borden best wel mee
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:50:35 - timcouwelier: tussenafstand tussen foto's op lijntrajecten meestal klein genoeg, detectie van zijwaartse objecten ligt moeilijker dan
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:56:28 - timcouwelier: https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=50.927301007370374&lng=3.146865013989782&z=17.762019774957242&focus=photo&signs=true&pKey=tg2yhCJDL1trok9RX8N3tQ&points=true&mapFeature%5B%5D=object--traffic-light--general-upright&mapFeature%5B%5D=marking--discrete--arrow--left&mapFeature%5B%5D=marking--discrete--arrow--right&mapFeature%5B%5D=marking--discrete--arrow--split-left-or-straight&mapFeature%5B%5D=marking--discrete--arrow--split-right-or-straight&mapFeature%5B%5D=object--traffic-cone
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:56:46 - timcouwelier: heh, was looking into the detections and found a 40 km/h speed limit
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:56:53 - timcouwelier: got me curious - it's an odd false positive.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 10:57:19 - timcouwelier: (also, note the drainpipe gets detected as a pole...)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:05:01 - joost_schouppe: why on earth the OSMF board does not use jit.si is a mistery to me
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:05:16 - Seppe: jup, pretty cool
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:05:55 - joost_schouppe: tevreden seppe?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:06:55 - Seppe: Ja, ca va. Belangrijkste nieuws denk ik was the gentlemen's agreement dat grote uploaders hun images geblurd kunnen terugkrijgen, helemaal gratis.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:07:02 - Seppe: Da's wel een mooie deal.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:07:11 - joost_schouppe: yep, dat is inderdaad z√©√©r goed nieuws
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:07:13 - Seppe: Zou goed zijn om die nog eens bevestigd te zien.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:07:20 - joost_schouppe: en ook dat ze hun privacy verhaal op orde hebben
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:07:40 - joost_schouppe: ik zou zeggen: we werken aan een document over de mogelijkheden, en laten hen dat nalezen
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:07:58 - Seppe: ja, lijkt me perfect
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:08:18 - timcouwelier: Wie telt als 'grote uploaders' btw?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:08:20 - joost_schouppe: topic lidar is ook helemaal neit aan bod gekomen
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:08:28 - timcouwelier: In casu - val ik daar zelf onder?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:08:45 - Seppe: Wie telt als 'grote uploaders' btw?
"a whole city"
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:08:54 - joost_schouppe: voor je eigen foto's denk ik dat dat eigenlijk gewoon voor iedereen geldt
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:09:00 - Seppe: maar dan misschien eerder in 360¬∞
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:09:03 - timcouwelier: Ja dat heb ik zo ongeveer ondertussen...  :p
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:09:38 - Seppe: 't Ging hem ook over een manier om die hele stad op een effici√´nte manier te kunnen uploaden √©n achteraf weer downloaden
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:09:49 - Seppe: dat kan blijkbaar via "command line tools"

Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:11:41 - Seppe: voor je eigen foto's denk ik dat dat eigenlijk gewoon voor iedereen geldt

Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:11:55 - Seppe: ja, was me eigenlijk nog niet opgevallen
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:12:33 - Seppe: maar de license verwijst wel naar CC BY SA 4.0
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:12:40 - timcouwelier: ja dat doe ik wel vaker eigenlijk, zo eentje downloaden
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:12:51 - timcouwelier: ook het onge√´diteerde plaatje kan je van eigen foto downloaden btw
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:12:56 - timcouwelier: maar niet in bulk.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:12:59 - Seppe: terwijl zij leek te zeggen dat er geen additionele licentie zou liggen bij het downloaden van de eigen imagery
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:13:18 - Seppe: (geprocessed dan)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:13:20 - joost_schouppe: op je eigen foto's heb je sowieso volledig eigenaarschap
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:13:31 - joost_schouppe: ik vermoed dat dat wel ergens gedocumenteerd staat hoor
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:14:05 - timcouwelier sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:14:14 - Seppe: ja, maar ze leek toch te zeggen dat voor big uploaders de licentie kon wegvallen voor geproceste images?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:14:57 - Seppe: (de "gentelemen's agreement")
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:15:19 - joost_schouppe: hmm, ja, ben misschien fout
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:16:18 - Seppe: goed om dit nog eens uit te klaren
want ze leek er zelf ook niet zo zeker van ("I'm pretty sure")
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:16:21 - joost_schouppe: eigenlijk is dat "niet deleten" een beetje onzin, aangezien: "Contributors grant Mapillary a worldwide, perpetual, and transferable license to use the images and other content for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. "
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:16:33 - joost_schouppe: mapillary kan dus in theorie dat deleten compleet negeren
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:16:34 - Seppe: :-)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:16:40 - Seppe: klopt
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:17:11 - Seppe: anyway, ik ga hier terug aan de slag met minder hippe dingen
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:17:28 - Seppe: ik vul de hackpad nog aan met mijn notities, maar zal misschien voor iets later zijn
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:17:52 - timcouwelier: Vrij vertaald: als ik iets upload kan ik niet van hen eisen dat ze het er weer afhalen.
De vraag is evenwel ook (beetje waar escada mee zit) is - wat als Mapillary er de stekker zou uittreken - heb ik dan garantie dat ik mijn eigen foto's in bulk kan downloaden?
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:18:32 - Seppe: Die "garantie" lijkt me niet realistisch.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:18:46 - Seppe: Sowieso behoud je de rechten op je eigen foto's
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:19:17 - Seppe: dus mag Mapillary er voor mijn part van uit gaan dat je er zelf netjes een backup van maakt in plaats van daarvoor te vertrouwen op hen
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:19:23 - Seppe: lijkt me billijk
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:19:35 - joost_schouppe: correct. heel expliciet hier: "We would like to assure the community that nothing in these Terms requires transfer of your ownership of photos taken with the Mapillary App"
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:20:01 - joost_schouppe: dus de ruwe foto's mag je sowieso nog voor alles gebruiken
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:20:11 - Seppe: mja, al deleten ze standaard die foto's wel na het uploaden
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:20:15 - timcouwelier: Ik heb historisch evenwel altijd up de app geupload ipv de desktop uiploader, waardoor ik niet van alles lokale kopies heb.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:20:26 - Seppe: exactly
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:20:26 - timcouwelier: om niet te zeggen: er amper heb
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:20:56 - Seppe: maar ikzelf ben er ook niet zo aan gehecht
voor een gemeente/stad zal dat wel anders liggen
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:21:06 - Seppe: (of voor een grote uploader als jij, Tim)
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:59:17 - timcouwelier: Gaat er meer over dat ik ze ook beroepshalve gebruik
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:59:31 - timcouwelier: en dat een 'plan B' dan nooit een slechte zaak is.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 11:59:52 - timcouwelier: btw Joost - 17 ongelezen berichten op OSM? :o
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 12:01:20 - timcouwelier: en een lokale kopie bijhouden.. hmm.. 230k foto's.. dat zal al snel iets van een 700GB zijn. Zelfs in bulk wordt dat onhandig downloaden lol
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 12:06:51 - joost_schouppe: meh
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 12:07:21 - joost_schouppe: ik lees die via mail; als het niet nodig is om te antwoorden, dan blijven die op ongelezen staan
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 12:07:39 - timcouwelier: dacht al dat je fanmail en groupies had en zo.
Mon, Jul 1, 2019, 12:07:47 - joost_schouppe: sowieso
Mon, Jul 8, 2019, 20:59:34 - joost_schouppe: ik heb nog een mailtje doorgestuurd om naar Madelen te sturen
Mon, Jul 8, 2019, 20:59:47 - joost_schouppe: ik stuur het door op woensdag, tenzij jullie meer tijd nodig hebben
Mon, Jul 8, 2019, 21:52:41 - timcouwelier: I'll re-read tomorrow, but initial feeling is you're claiming it's going to be a tough sale as it is AND on top you want to swipe in and get some of the action too.
Mon, Jul 8, 2019, 21:54:02 - timcouwelier: geen idee waarom ik naar engels ging ...
Mon, Jul 8, 2019, 21:55:21 - timcouwelier: op basis van wat ik zag voorbij komen, valt het luik 'data inzameling' best wel mee.  Al gaan ze in het begin gewoon vrij zwaar het hosten van oude foto's uitmelken.
Mon, Jul 8, 2019, 21:56:25 - timcouwelier: zolang niemand anders met een goedkoper alternatief komt, of google der nog eens volledig voor gaat, hebben ze daar wel een marksegment voor.  Zeker omdat de data effectief wel kwalitatief is
Mon, Jul 8, 2019, 21:56:32 - timcouwelier: en de toestellen toch al lang afgeschreven zijn.
Mon, Jul 8, 2019, 22:02:52 - joost_schouppe: Pfwuut, dat in swipen hoeft voor mij niet per se hoor. Als er iemand anders het doet, des te beter
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:08:31 - joost_schouppe: dus ik wil dat er wel uithalen als je dat beter lijkt; of meer formuleren van "ook wij kunnen helpen met het nemen van de foto's als jullie dat niet willen doen"
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:09:27 - joost_schouppe: en misschien moet ik wat meer in de verf zetten dat er wel degelijk geld te verdienen valt? Ik wou vooral meegeven: "we moeten zien dat het verkoopbaar is", niet "hier valt niets te verdienen"
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:14:45 - timcouwelier: ik vind het wat bizar eigenlijk, als ik naar die offertes kijk
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:14:56 - timcouwelier: Moerbeke en Zulte moet je even vergelijken - hosten historische data vs inwinnen nieuwe
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:16:20 - timcouwelier: Beetje een dubbel gevoel bij de historische aanbesteding door AGIV - dat de opdrachtnemer het eigendomsrecht op de afbeeldingen behoudt. Dat lijkt me wat vreemd eigenlijk.
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:20:19 - timcouwelier: Los daarvan moet ik wel toegeven dat image-v veel scherper zit in prijs dan wat ik verwacht had, ik had snel op pakweg het drievoud gegokt.
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:20:56 - timcouwelier: Maar dat scheelt ook, nu is het voor hen vooral personeelskost, die investeringskost voor de camera's is wel weg ondertussen.. en die weegt zwaar
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:23:08 - timcouwelier: Maar het besloten karakter van de data betekent natuurlijk ook dat de serverload zeer beperkt is, het is meer een issue van storage dan van bandbreedte.
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 09:26:18 - timcouwelier: Maar ik denk persoonlijk dat ik het bussinessmodel van Mapillary niet helemaal snap.
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 13:56:42 - joost_schouppe: die willen gewoon expert zijn in machine learning. En toevallig zijn er mensen die willen betalen tot toegang tot de foto's die Mapillary daarvoor nodig heeft. Dus willen ze daar wel een centje meepikken. Maar het is niet echt een prioriteit, aangezien voor hen volledigheid niet echt nodig is. Gelukkig, want anders waren ze er ook nooit mee begonnen. De vraag is dus vooral of ze ondertussen inzien dat dat centje meepikken nog wel kan oplopen.
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 13:56:48 - joost_schouppe: Afijn, da's hoe ik het lees
Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 14:40:45 - timcouwelier sent an image. (Media omitted)

Tue, Jul 9, 2019, 14:42:25 - timcouwelier: en ofwel onderschat ik wat dit inhoudt, maar dat lijkt me toch ook best prijzig?

Wed, Jul 17, 2019, 16:42:57 - joost_schouppe: Tof he
Wed, Jul 17, 2019, 16:54:30 - timcouwelier: De klokt tikt nochtans flink in het nadeel denk ik dan.
Mon, Aug 5, 2019, 22:03:40 - timcouwelier: even in de rand: mail van mapillary dat ik er alleszins niet direct bij zit voor camera grant program, gezien de verhouding tussen vraag en aanbod, maar dat ze periodiek op de aanvragen zullen terugvallen en kijken waar ze best heen kunnen.
Mon, Aug 5, 2019, 22:05:00 - timcouwelier: eerlijkheidshalve: ik vind het wat tegenvallen dan. Zou beter een telefoon met snert-kwaliteit camera beginnen gebruiken in de plaats...
Mon, Aug 5, 2019, 22:06:07 - timcouwelier: (zei hij, terwijl hij weer een 10k foto's aan het opladen is...)
Tue, Aug 6, 2019, 08:51:37 - joost_schouppe: haha
Tue, Aug 6, 2019, 08:52:02 - joost_schouppe: wel euh, volgens mij als we een gerichte campagne doen met osm.be moeten we wel wat camera's kunnen financieren
Tue, Aug 6, 2019, 08:52:15 - joost_schouppe: ik wou dat doen in het voorjaar, maar is er niet van gekomen
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:48:40 - timcouwelier: Hey, ik heb net een halfuurtje aan de lijn gehangen met Wouter Verhelst (WVI)
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:48:58 - timcouwelier: aantal dingen beroepshalve, maar topic kwam ook op Openstreetmap / mapillary.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:57:04 - timcouwelier: WVI (nu ja, wouter zelf en een collega) zijn het Mapillary-idee wel genegen. Ze zijn evenwel wat op zoek naar welke rol zij als intercommunale kunnen hebben
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:57:29 - timcouwelier: blijkbaar is het op heden niet zo dat een 'groepsaankoop' vanuit de 54 gemeentes waar ze actief zijn veel kan wegen op de prijs
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:57:46 - joost_schouppe: maar wel op de eenvoud, niet?
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:57:49 - timcouwelier: maar wel overwegen ze bvb de aankoop van een 360¬∞ camera die uitgeleend kan worden aan hun gemeentes
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:58:06 - timcouwelier: wat dan weer een goede link kan vormen met Mapillary.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:59:08 - timcouwelier: Zo kunnen de gemeentes zich in principe zelf voorzien van beeldmateriaal, met een frequentie volgens eigen keuze.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 09:59:56 - timcouwelier: Op een dagje kan je in principe best wel wat terrein coveren anyway.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:01:41 - timcouwelier: En 'wegen op de eenvoud' -> gohja, het is makkelijker werken als iedereen op gelijkaardige wijze werkt natuurlijk. Een grote soep qua aanbieders/ platformen / werkwijzes maakt het er niet makkelijker op alleszins.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:12:05 - timcouwelier: Maar een overleg WVI / Mapillary / OSM zag wouter wel zitten eigenlijk. (en hij suggereerde zelf om daarbij eventueel mensen vanuit OSM mee bij te betrekken)
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:12:32 - timcouwelier: Wellicht omdat we zelf ondertussen redelijk weten wat kan of niet, en welke accenten belangrijk zijn.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:17:42 - timcouwelier: (fwiw: cyclomedia blijkt op heden de enige partij te zijn die een soort 'prijszetting ifv schaalgroote' hanteert, bij andere partijen lijkt de totaalprijs eerder de som van de individuele prijzen)
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:24:30 - joost_schouppe: merci voor de update alleszins. En zo'n gedeelde camera zou wel fantastisch zijn; zeker als jij die ook eens zou mogen lenen af en toe :)
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:25:45 - joost_schouppe: Madelen is "voor een paar weken weg" sinds 17 juli. Wanneer mag ik haar nog eens lastigvallen?
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:26:36 - timcouwelier: ik zou niet te lang wachten eigenlijk.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:27:03 - timcouwelier: btw, filipc heeft een blackvue dashcam via het camera grant program - voor zover dat niet bekend was
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:28:34 - joost_schouppe: begot
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:28:40 - joost_schouppe: alleh, da's goed
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:28:42 - joost_schouppe: en wist ik niet
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:30:29 - timcouwelier: ik zag recente foto's van hem via zo'n dashcam en heb het hem gevraagd

Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:32:19 - timcouwelier: da's de reactie die ik zelf kreeg.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:33:09 - timcouwelier: ik had denk ik mijn lat niet hoog genoeg gelegd.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:44:25 - joost_schouppe: Jo is precies wta stilgevallen; ik vraag eens hoe het zit
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:44:35 - joost_schouppe: en ik vind dat wij er gewoon vijf zouden moeten krijgen, maar bon
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:44:48 - joost_schouppe: we hebben vooral iemand nodig die eens actief op zoek gaat naar sponsering
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 10:45:00 - joost_schouppe: kunnen we combineren met onze blog post over dit verhaal
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 11:43:07 - timcouwelier: Mjah, kan aan vakantie liggen ook natuurlijk.
Tue, Aug 13, 2019, 11:43:31 - timcouwelier: Op zich best happy met mn tweedehandse GoPro, alleen wat gedoe met de omweg om geotags toe te voegen.
Mon, Aug 26, 2019, 16:52:53 - Seppe: Ondertussen zie ik hier een mailtje passeren met de vraag of we toch geen gebruiksrecht zouden aankopen voor √©√©n jaar voor de beelden van 2016 ...
Mon, Aug 26, 2019, 16:54:44 - Seppe sent an image. (Media omitted)
Fri, Aug 30, 2019, 09:45:20 - timcouwelier: Seppe: lijkt me helaas het pijnlijke gevolg van 'geen actie van kant mapillary'.
Fri, Aug 30, 2019, 09:45:36 - timcouwelier: joost_schouppe: je laatste mail om de boel wat op te stoken was een goed idee
Fri, Aug 30, 2019, 09:45:57 - timcouwelier: Algemeen: Jezus, ik ben aardig aan het verwateren op de beelden via die blackvue dashcam...
Fri, Aug 30, 2019, 09:46:57 - joost_schouppe: verwateren?
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 16:19:01 - joost_schouppe: ik heb de gopro terug. Al direct een paar 1000 beelden geschoten.

Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 16:35:17 - joost_schouppe: neen
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 16:36:01 - joost_schouppe: maar hij had al een tijdje geen foto's opgeladen, en ik had zelf een paar projectjes

Goeie tekst.
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 20:53:18 - Seppe: Ik zou wel nog wat suggesties durven doen. Belangrijkste: 't is niet echt duidelijk uit de tekst zelf wie "wij" zijn en waarom een overheid vertrouwen in ons zou moeten hebben.
Ik betwijfel bijv. of "If you lend us a camera and some basic funding" ooit gaat werken voor een lokaal bestuur.
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 21:00:32 - joost_schouppe: Goh, we kunnen met verschillende niveaus beginnen. Dat kan gerust zijn organisationnelle steun
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 21:02:12 - joost_schouppe: meestal wordt zo'n "wie schrijft dit" een beetje afzonderlijk van de eigenlijke tekst gezet, niet? Maar pas maar aan he, is maar een voorzet. Dankzij een lange treinrit :)) (Brugge - Trois-Ponts)
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 21:15:12 - Seppe: 't Is ne heel schone voorzet. Ik probeer hier en daar nog wat suggesties toe te voegen.
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 23:48:51 - Seppe: Wat zou je willen bereiken met de wish list? Dat ze ons eentje cadeau doen? Ergens in de tekst zeg je "lend us your camera", dus da's wat verwarrend.
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 23:50:03 - joost_schouppe: Ha dju. Ik had eerst "koop ons een camera". Maar er zijn ook mensen die er ons een willen geven. Met name Fietsersbond sprak daarvan.
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 23:51:20 - joost_schouppe: Ik zou deze tekst vooral willen gebruiken om te hinten maar samenwerken met ons, en dan op osm.be zelf een pagina met meer detail te zetten. Maar ik had voor Fietsersbond nu al een shopping lijstje nodig
Fri, Sep 6, 2019, 23:51:39 - Seppe: :-)
Sat, Sep 7, 2019, 00:04:27 - Seppe: Eerste helft al eens doorgenomen, rest zal voor later zijn
Sat, Sep 7, 2019, 00:06:09 - joost_schouppe: Thanks
Sat, Sep 7, 2019, 00:08:52 - Seppe: uiteraard allemaal suggesties, draai ze gerust terug als je vindt dat het geen verbeteringen zijn
Mon, Sep 9, 2019, 23:50:45 - Seppe: De deadline voor de tekst was morgen zeker? Nog geen tijd / courage gehad voor verdere grondige review van de tekst
Maar kan zeker ook zo weg wat mij betreft
Mon, Sep 9, 2019, 23:55:49 - timcouwelier: Looks fine to me. I'd probably specify the models on the blackvue dashcam though, for those willing to search price ranges. It's rather specific which ones are compatible wit the desktop uploader
Mon, Sep 9, 2019, 23:55:59 - timcouwelier: also, it appears I think in english when tired
Mon, Sep 9, 2019, 23:56:30 - timcouwelier: In mijn bed geraken lijkt even moeilijk voor mij als het voor een brit is om uit de EU te geraken.

Tue, Sep 10, 2019, 08:01:19 - joost_schouppe: Ha! Jullie mogen er gerust nog verder in aanvullen. Alleen bespreken ze het vandaag op okbe, dus wou ik tegen vandaag iets min of meer ok hebben

Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 20:22:32 - Seppe: Feedback gekregen vanuit Open Knowledge?
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 21:00:05 - joost_schouppe: Dag 
Joost, ik heb uw voorstel gisteren geagendeerd op de 
bestuursvergadering. Alle bestuursleden waren positief en willen dit 
initiatief ondersteunen en helpen verspreiden. Er werd zelfs al een idee
 voor een oSoc project gelanceerd: combinatie van collectie van foto's 
met de vloot van elektrische wagens bij de Vlaamse overheid.. (details 
moeten nog uitgewerkt worden  )


Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 21:00:07 - joost_schouppe: van Astrid
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 21:00:41 - joost_schouppe: maar dus verder nog niets concreets. Wat kan ik vragen op korte termijn?
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 21:01:25 - joost_schouppe: Ik zou alleszins de tekst al naar Ward van Hal van VVSG GIS en Joris Voets van de Centrumsteden willen sturen
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 21:01:39 - joost_schouppe: Vragen of OKBE wil proberen hier een opiniestuk van te maken
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 21:01:42 - joost_schouppe: Que mas?
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 21:19:17 - Seppe: Blogpost oid zou al goed zijn, in de hoop dat het dan wat verspreid geraakt
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 21:37:54 - joost_schouppe: Ok. Ik zal eerst effe nog vragen aan okbe of ze nog zouden herschrijven

Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 22:28:40 - joost_schouppe: I thought there was a bee in my pants. Threw down the bike. Dropped my pants. Found the "bee" was a sharp pebble. The camera was on the bike. Kept taking pictures.
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 22:28:53 - joost_schouppe: In the background, the ladies are making fun of me
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 22:56:15 - Seppe: Haha, elaborate alibi
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 22:58:15 - joost_schouppe: T was a little too hilarious not to share
Mon, Sep 16, 2019, 23:01:16 - Jonathan: Daaaamn that's an hilarious story indeed üòÇ
Thu, Sep 26, 2019, 17:45:06 - joost_schouppe: I talke to a few of the Mapillary guys at SotM. They seemed a bit surprised by the lack of will of Mapillary to give a bit more to get more. It's just the commercial department wanting Money! I think they might actually be willing to give it another internal push, and they were really interested in the blog post we have coming up

Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 09:54:23 - timcouwelier: based on last email - I assume you mean talking to someone from AWV / MOW ?

Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 10:00:45 - joost_schouppe: oh I'll trow the article on linkedin
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 10:01:53 - timcouwelier: I spoke with her after an info session she gave for OVIO-members, that's where I remember her from. As far as opening up AWV data goes, I think she's high enough up the ladder to have an actual say in it.
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 10:02:07 - joost_schouppe: oooh nice
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 10:02:21 - joost_schouppe: maybe you can share the post with her
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 10:02:35 - joost_schouppe: I already sent it to Ward van Hal and Joris Voets

Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 17:26:03 - timcouwelier: okay, dit is wat ik hem mailde:
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 17:26:05 - timcouwelier: Wouter,

Via Joost Schouppe werd ik gewezen op de sessie van volgende week. Zonet ook via de website ingeschreven.
Mijn agenda laat de ochtendsessie helaas niet toe, maar ik zou toch minstens gedeeltelijk de namiddagsessie proberen meevolgen.

Zo relevant ben ik ook beschikbaar ikv vragen rond Mapillary of toepassingsgebied meer open datastructuren‚Ä¶
Moest je over bepaalde dingen nog willen afstemmen of bepaalde afspraken maken ‚Äì graag via mijn prive mailadres (hier in kopie), of via GSM 0474 80 14 49 (ook hier: prive nr).

Wat relevant is richting OSM koppel ik sowieso terug naar Joost Schouppe en andere actoren.
Joost probeert je wellicht ook nog telefonisch te pakken te krijgen.
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 19:29:23 - joost_schouppe: daarnet met Wouter van WVI gebeld. Hun idee is: leg met een paar gemeenten samen voor een camera van 5000 euro, en doe het gewoon zelf. Als platform hadden ze eigenlijk in de eerste plaats aan Google StreetView gedacht. Blijkbaar kan je daar ook naar opladen, en zijn er ook plugins voor gebruik in ArcGIS etc. En bovendien beter verkoopbaar als city marketing.
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 19:45:16 - Seppe: Eerste deel lijkt me een goed idee, tweede deel lijkt me een heel slecht idee ...
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 19:47:07 - joost_schouppe: Argumenteer maar! :)
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 19:47:39 - joost_schouppe: Oh, en extreme gebruiksvriendelijkheid is volgens hem ook belangrijk. Wat dat betreft zitten we wel redelijk ok met Mapillary denk ik
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 19:49:15 - joost_schouppe: Gebruiksvriendelijk vanuit standpunt van data verzameling bedoel ik
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:00:05 - Seppe: hmmm, nog niet zo simpel eigenlijk
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:00:11 - Seppe sent an image. (Media omitted)
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:00:33 - Seppe: deze redelijkheid had ik bijvoorbeeld niet direct verwacht (m.a.w. beetje bevooroordeeld ... )
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:21:06 - joost_schouppe: Maar mag je het echt gebruiken? Dat vond Wouter bij Mapillary ook vreemd. Boerenverstand : "ze kunnen toch niet controleren dat ik naar die foto's heb gekeken, waarom zouden ze het dan verbieden"
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:24:29 - Seppe: Verschil is natuurlijk: als je je eigen imagery via Google publiceert, dan mogen anderen die beelden niet gebruiken om te tracen, data eruit te extraheren ... Met Mapillary mag dat wel onder CC-BY-SA4.0 (en voor OSM)
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:25:44 - joost_schouppe: Da's t belangrijkste verschil denk ik. Maar daar staat tegenover dat Jan met de Pet de foto's minder gemakkelijk gaat vinden
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:26:02 - joost_schouppe: Oh, en natuurlijk allerlei automatische detectie waar ze iets mee kunnen doen
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:26:04 - Seppe: Maar 'k zit nu wel te denken: waarom niet naar beide uploaden?
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:26:14 - joost_schouppe: Uiteraard
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:26:21 - joost_schouppe: Maar das wel meer werk he
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:27:00 - Seppe: mja, maar die ambtenaren moeten ook iets te doen hebben h√© üòã
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:27:06 - joost_schouppe: Idealiter : naar een neutraal platform waar iedereen de foto's kan komen halen
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:27:17 - joost_schouppe: Ej!
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:30:01 - Seppe: Klopt, maar dan moeten ze wel al geproprocessed zijn
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:31:21 - joost_schouppe: Ja, dat, ofwel geef je enkel toegang aan mensen die de privacy kunnen garanderen
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:47:52 - timcouwelier: De vraag is of 'jan met de pet' ze direct moet vinden natuurlijk. Als de ambtenaren ze al vinden..
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:49:25 - timcouwelier: Voor Mapillary - als er demo gegeven wordt rond de locatie van waar de presentatie doorgaat, zitten ze natuurlijk wel met een leuke dekkingsgraad
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:49:27 - timcouwelier: dat scheelt al weer
Fri, Sep 27, 2019, 20:49:40 - timcouwelier: Ook OSM is daar behoorlijk up to date / accuraat
Sat, Sep 28, 2019, 10:12:26 - joost_schouppe: ja, ik zou zeker ook de nadruk leggen op het gemak van osm data. vb voor boekenkastjes, hondenwc's, fietsenstallingen, publieke parking, etc
Mon, Sep 30, 2019, 13:00:33 - joost_schouppe: ik ben eens aan het kijken naar professionele camera's. Hier staan er enkele: https://help.mapillary.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001465989-About-360-cameras . Die van Trimble zijn ongeveer 60.000 USD :)
Mon, Sep 30, 2019, 13:01:16 - joost_schouppe: Maar NCTech iSTAR Pulsar deze is minder dan 4000 euro, en kan rechtsreeks naar google streetview opladen. Ik heb dus eens gevraagd of ze ook naar mapillary en osc kunnen opladen :)
Mon, Sep 30, 2019, 19:29:56 - joost_schouppe: "We do not have any direct publishing¬†pipelines for other mapping

Zou eigenlijk wel leuk zijn om eens een paar verschillende camera's te huren en er een test mee te doen, dan weten we direct waarover we spreken.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 11:40:54 - Seppe: Misschien probeer ik dat wel eens op het werk, maar 't zal nog niet voor direct zijn.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 14:11:11 - joost_schouppe: Sorry Tim, de aangetekende zending is omdat ik 1000 euro extra terugkrijg op mijn belastingen
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 15:17:10 - timcouwelier: Mapillary wordt hier vrij enthousiast onthaald, evenals de suggestie voor een intercommunale camera.. later meer info 
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 15:21:29 - timcouwelier: Heb een stukje van Wouter zn presentatie gekaapt vanuit het publiek. Maar dat leek hij niet erg te vinden

Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 15:34:14 - joost_schouppe: Ondertussen is dat ook typisch
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 15:41:14 - timcouwelier: Clou is dat je geen streetview kan tonen zonder bijgaande kaart van Google zelf
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 15:41:35 - timcouwelier: En dat ze aantal API calls zo limiteren voor niet betalende users

Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:47:42 - timcouwelier: I wanted to keep one wheel on the high end and one on the side, to avoid bottom of car getting stuck on the higher midsection.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:48:43 - timcouwelier: That said - WVI was pro-mapillary, both Wouter Verhelst and Bart Boute. They did claim though that if they'd go the mapillary route, they'd push for the use of 360¬∞ cams. Not 'top end' but not 'rubbish' either.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:48:44 - Seppe: > of doen een googleke en we openstreetviewen iets uitzonderlijk?

I like that idea
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:49:11 - timcouwelier: Gemeente Zulte in particular was VERY enthousiastic about Mapillary as a low-cost, low-tech alternative.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:49:34 - timcouwelier: They did read your blog post in detail Joost :)
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:49:50 - timcouwelier: they plan on making a post of their own soon, based on the demo's and info from today.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:50:23 - timcouwelier: through https://www.wvigisco.be/
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:50:36 - timcouwelier: they asked me to share it with the OSM community once it comes up.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:52:20 - timcouwelier: Bart did say that, had we found out the connection on less-short-notice, they'd probably have given me a bigger platform or a speech slot to make the mapillary / openstreetmap case
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:52:50 - timcouwelier: But I did manage to at least get some peoples attention. Should today's presentations be shared, I'll repost them here.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:54:36 - timcouwelier: The take on prefering 360¬∞ is probably what made them focus on camera's like a GoPro Fusion, rather then the dashcam/smartphone approach though
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:56:04 - Seppe: > The take on prefering 360¬∞ is probably what made them focus on camera's like a GoPro Fusion, rather then the dashcam/smartphone approach though

If I would collect street view imagery for work, I would alsof go straight to 360¬∞
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:58:35 - timcouwelier: Yea I just pointed out that the base data fill that's in there for now is mostly hobbyists, nearly entirely from the OSM community, which don't always want to make a (for a single person) considerable investment for a camera
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:58:54 - timcouwelier: while the same amount, at municipality level (or intercommunale) may be .. peanuts.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 17:59:27 - timcouwelier: And there's still the saying 'if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys', but I didn't want to portray us as 'the monkeys' lol
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 18:00:40 - timcouwelier: About half the WVI-municipalities were represented btw - which should be 27 out of 24.
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 18:00:46 - timcouwelier: out of  54*
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 18:00:57 - Seppe: > > of doen een googleke en we openstreetviewen iets uitzonderlijk?

> I like that idea

I would go for new infrastructure. Then we could say we mapped it first AND we had the first street view imagery
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 18:01:35 - timcouwelier: Look at 3A complex, Roeselare.

Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 18:22:50 - joost_schouppe: I'm going to the flagis workshop on October 8th. I hope you or some of the WVI people show up too
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 18:24:25 - joost_schouppe: about the 360 camera, I also vastly prefer a decent 360 image. But I'm not convinced the GoPro is good enough. I wonder if there's something in the 3000-5000 range that is vastly superior
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 18:27:12 - joost_schouppe: like, this is nice, but I can't actually read that cycle route sign: https://www.mapillary.com/app/user/peewee32?lat=50.7029067777778&lng=3.6000556666666625&z=17&panos=true&pKey=LjoF2GrdPBuUu3p8PfmZqw&focus=photo&x=0.5900170697398155&y=0.504520533719247&zoom=2.2871664548919948

Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 20:53:47 - timcouwelier: They had reference for a 5k EUR decent 360 cam too
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 20:54:12 - timcouwelier: forgot to write down specs though
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 20:54:38 - timcouwelier: which is what they'd consider getting themselves to loan/rent out to municipalities willing to put it to use
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 20:55:18 - timcouwelier: our survey team at work got a new camera too. It's pretty much like your every day photo camera (so no smart phone or so) but it makes georeffed images too
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 20:55:39 - timcouwelier: Did a test run - I can upload those to mapillary too
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 20:55:58 - timcouwelier: GoPro was taken into consideration, but the lack of a cam 'flash' to make pictures inside sewer manholes was too big a downside
Tue, Oct 1, 2019, 20:59:14 - timcouwelier: Also, having a look at the flagis thingy. Probably alot of repeat pitches from today

Actually, I hadn't seen any GoPro Fusion imagery before, so I did a global search :-)

Mon, Oct 7, 2019, 13:08:56 - joost_schouppe: Jaja, zo had ik het zelfs beloofd aan Mapillary oorspronkelijk
Mon, Oct 7, 2019, 13:27:39 - timcouwelier: Ik volg overigens nog eens op via Wouter - presentaties van vorige week opvragen en zo. En vanuit WVI is me gevraagd een eventuele nieuwspost van henzelf nadien ook hier te delen.
Mon, Oct 7, 2019, 13:28:11 - timcouwelier: en heb ook nog zo'n ritten gedaan
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:42:25 - joost_schouppe: Live from flagis.be
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:44:06 - joost_schouppe: 1) cyclomedia. Hebben een mooi filmpje.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:44:16 - Seppe: Go get'em
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:44:26 - Seppe sent an image. (Media omitted)
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:46:27 - timcouwelier: Yea I missed Cyclomedia and err..  whatever the second one was, with a flemish family name.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:47:08 - timcouwelier: Vansteelandt.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:47:41 - timcouwelier: Seen Geckomatics, not sure if they are there too.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:51:08 - joost_schouppe: they do seem to have a nice product
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:51:34 - joost_schouppe: ArcGIS: de voorbeelden van hen ivm Mobile Mapping is inclusief Mapillary
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:55:30 - timcouwelier: Yea, overall - the quality of commercial alternatives is pretty awesome, if you ask me
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:55:30 - joost_schouppe: hoewel hun pagina over het thema dat niet bevat: https://esribelux.com/mobile-mapping/
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:57:24 - timcouwelier: Mapillary isn't competing with some of the functionality the pitching players there have, for the most part. They are an alternative for your local municipality employee willing to review a notification they received without leaving their desk, especially when Google Streetview is either outdated, or at some point becomes paywalled.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 09:59:50 - timcouwelier: ESRI states they are compatible with all vendors out there - Mapillary, Image-V, Cyclomedia, ...
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 10:02:11 - timcouwelier: While I tend to think - I'll just load up a browser in my second monitor and use that - cost avoided.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 10:05:27 - timcouwelier sent an image. (Media omitted)
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 10:05:41 - timcouwelier: in case you havent used it - go2Mapillary plugin for QGis
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 10:30:33 - joost_schouppe: lot's of data+service providers combined
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 10:56:42 - joost_schouppe: "realview by siggis" ziet er interessant uit
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 11:09:18 - timcouwelier: meeste van die dingen hoor - de vraag is alleen of de kost gerechtvaardig is in verhouding tot het aantal gebruikers. Moet je eens op letten - hoe de afbeeldingen beschikbaar komen is maar voor een ZEER BEPERKT aantal gebruikers die toegang hebben - het grote publiek sowieso al niet. Dat scheelt een pak in bandbreedte en hostingseisen.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 11:10:09 - joost_schouppe: http://vansteelandt.obliquo.cloud/#! osm.org, no attribution...
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 11:18:37 - timcouwelier: I've seen others use OSM as basemap too, wasn't able to check attribution.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 13:15:42 - joost_schouppe: Well my intervention certainly made an impact
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 13:17:01 - joost_schouppe: Iets met een knuppel en een hoenderhok
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 13:17:12 - joost_schouppe: En Wouter gaat er excellent mee aan de slag
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 13:32:39 - timcouwelier: Vond ik ook. Wouter daar ook misschien?
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 13:33:45 - timcouwelier: afspraak hier intern met onze landmeters is ook dat hun opmetingsfoto's (voor zover het bovengronds is en geen rioleringsputten) bij mij gemeld worden, zodat ik even kan nagaan wat het uploaden waard is.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 13:33:52 - timcouwelier: (nieuwe camera met GPS)
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 15:48:09 - joost_schouppe: Wouter nam deel aan het debat!
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 15:50:13 - timcouwelier: ow right.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 15:50:25 - timcouwelier: Dame van AWV een zinnig en/of duidelijk standpunt ingenomen?
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 15:53:26 - joost_schouppe: Nope
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 15:54:00 - timcouwelier: Dat valt me wat tegen dan, had het daar wel verwacht.
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 15:54:22 - joost_schouppe: Bwah, ze heeft wel zinnige dingen gezegd, maar niet specifiek over straatbeelden
Tue, Oct 8, 2019, 17:30:31 - Seppe: > Well my intervention certainly made an impact

Wed, Oct 9, 2019, 14:08:47 - timcouwelier: Even de vrijheid genomen zelf even wat feedback aan Mapillary te kaatsen.
Wed, Oct 9, 2019, 14:08:57 - timcouwelier: Soms kan het geen kwaad dat ze eens een tweede, derde, .. stem horen.
Wed, Oct 9, 2019, 21:07:40 - joost_schouppe: in tegendeel
Fri, Oct 11, 2019, 09:05:39 - timcouwelier: Nu even zien hoe lang het duurt voor het gaat van 'bedankt voor je input' naar 'ok, kan je nu even stil zijn ook?' :)

https://www.mapillary.com/map/im/SXS2gLMCAL_hv4Nuh_cTVA
Wed, Oct 16, 2019, 10:22:30 - timcouwelier: 2.1k foto's toch al. Moet zijn dat ze toch overwegen het rondrijden om data voor anderen te verzamelen aan te bieden?
Wed, Oct 16, 2019, 10:23:20 - timcouwelier: Kwaliteit van de foto's ziet er redelijk uit, maar helemaal top zijn ze toch ook nog niet..
Wed, Oct 16, 2019, 10:54:17 - Seppe: Kwaliteit van de foto's ziet er redelijk uit, maar helemaal top zijn ze toch ook nog niet..
Klopt. Blijkbaar met GoPro Fusion gemaakt.
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 18:42:56 - xivk: Hey I just had a nice chat with someone from Geckomatics they do imagery collection or offer hardware to do this to local administrations
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 18:43:18 - xivk: I think they can also become allies in this conversation
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 18:43:44 - joost_schouppe: Oh cool
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 18:50:21 - joost_schouppe: Their business model seems to be detections, what would be their win to Shae images that allow more people to "detect things"? Or maybe they'd charge their clients for the service of publishing the images somewhere else?
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 19:00:01 - Seppe: <@xivk:matrix.org "I think they can also become all..."> Nice!
But I was surprised to see they breach GDPR on the frontpage of their website ...
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 19:06:59 - joost_schouppe: you mean the uncensored license plates? or the automatically-accepted cookies?
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 19:09:57 - Seppe: üôÇ I was talking about the uncensored license plates. But maybe the cookies are worse ...
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 19:29:10 - xivk: Haha part of our conversation was GDPR ;-)
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 19:29:36 - xivk: I'm sure they are open to this kind of feedback
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 19:30:20 - xivk: What i liked was that they offer a service ans the data ownership stays with users
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 19:31:22 - xivk: These guys sponsored one of our first mapathons ever btw
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 19:38:59 - joost_schouppe: I'd like to learn more. Will they be at AIV trefdag?
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 20:28:15 - xivk: Hmm maybe I'll email they with some of you in CC later
Wed, Nov 6, 2019, 20:28:31 - xivk: Grr them
Thu, Nov 7, 2019, 00:01:03 - timcouwelier: Joost, their presentation is in the WVI info too
Thu, Nov 7, 2019, 00:01:20 - timcouwelier: Ill admit GPS accuracy of their imagery is one of their key focus points
Thu, Nov 7, 2019, 00:01:30 - timcouwelier: which seems well.. usefull.
Fri, Jan 31, 2020, 19:34:08 - joost_schouppe: Vansteeland didn't use their 360¬∞ since september. How about we ask them if we can lend it?
Mon, Feb 3, 2020, 19:59:43 - joost_schouppe invited Thibaultmol
Mon, Feb 3, 2020, 19:59:58 - Thibaultmol joined the room
Tue, Feb 4, 2020, 08:08:30 - joost_schouppe: van thibault: Been looking into the 360 camera situation again.
There are some problems with picking the GoPro Fusion 360:

    The camera's desktop stitching software seems to not have had any updates in the last half year or so.
    Stitching process requires gpu with atleast 4GB of ram. and 8GB of system ram. So some people might not have pc's with such specs
    There is a CPU-only stitcher, but that takes a very long time and not sure how well maintained it is
    Mapillary does (not advertise it much) but actually offers a way to upload your raw images from the Fusion to their servers and have it process on their end.
    Emailed Mapillary asking some questions and they basically said that the Fusion seems abandoned by GoPro. And so they're looking into making the new GoPro Max Mapillary friendly (in regards to workflow). They'll get back to me in a couple weeks with an update on that.
    (from what I read on the forums, the main problem is that the Max doesn't have a timelapse mode like the Fusion. And some people mentioned it doesn't center on the horizon (but I think that was someone confusing it with something else))
    Regarding other 360 cam options, most new camera's are out of our budget range or don't offer much better quality than the GoPro' (Kandao Qoocam 8K in theory has better quality but "early image samples don‚Äôt show much of an edge over Theta Z1, for example")

TL;DR: Waiting on Mapillary looking into the GoPro Max as potential new 'recommended 360 camera for Mapillary

Tue, Feb 4, 2020, 08:09:04 - joost_schouppe: timcouwelier: als WVI hun 360 nog niet gekocht hebben, dan is dit misschien wel de moeite om met hen te delen!
Tue, Feb 4, 2020, 08:45:25 - timcouwelier: I was retrieving their blogpost on their info session
Tue, Feb 4, 2020, 08:45:26 - timcouwelier: https://www.wvigisco.be/uncategorized/kennisdag-wvi-360-beeldendatabank/
Tue, Feb 4, 2020, 08:45:36 - timcouwelier: look at the author name- ring a bell?
Tue, Feb 4, 2020, 08:47:04 - joost_schouppe: I found that post a few days ago after googling that name :)
Mon, Feb 17, 2020, 21:47:09 - Seppe: https://twitter.com/leiedal/status/1229347281322770433?s=09
Fri, Mar 13, 2020, 10:11:47 - Seppe set a profile picture
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:40:34 - joost_schouppe: well I have 113.000 images ready for upload from my camper trip. Is this now a controversial thing to do?
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:41:58 - Thibaultmol: I'm mainly confused about the exact purpose. Cause i'm still getting mixed signals. Seems like Mapillary has full rights to the images, so some people just go 'does it matter'?
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:42:31 - Thibaultmol: Cause it seems highly unlikely that facebook would take down the entire catalog of images out of nowhere.
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:51:14 - Thibaultmol: (but I could dedicate 6TB of raid6 storage from my synology to help with the storage i guess)
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:52:30 - Thibaultmol: maybe some kind of decentralized storage system would be an option? (although the ones that I know don't have an easy option to just combine storage from community members into one easy accesible storage pool system.
They mostly focus on people who sell storage and people who buy storage.
Not 'free within the community of users' stuff)
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:53:07 - Thibaultmol: (don't know how OSM FR are storing their data. but I can imagine that needing to increase massively with the amount of people that are going to be dowloading the coming weeks)
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:54:00 - joost_schouppe: one of the main reasons Facebook bought Mapillary is probably for them to help improve OpenStreetMap. So I wouldn't worry about the project going offline for us
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:54:36 - Thibaultmol: yeah, my mentality is the same. but I do kinda get why people want 'their own copy, you never know!'
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:56:19 - joost_schouppe: oh yeah, absolutely
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:56:51 - joost_schouppe: but there's also the people who want to actively remove eveyrthying (or at least not contribute more) because it's Facebook
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:57:12 - joost_schouppe: since Facebook does have a track record of evil things
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:57:40 - joost_schouppe: I would personally prefer to anonymise images before giving them to facebook now
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:58:33 - Thibaultmol: yeah, I don't have many up there. but i'll keep mine up as well.
And yeah actually some kind of preprocessing locally would be a good mentality
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 19:59:26 - Thibaultmol: If people really need some storage for their images, hit me up I guess
(my download is 1 gig, so should go fast. but my upload is only 45. so just keep that in mind)
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 20:00:53 - joost_schouppe: eh, as long as osm-fr is offering their servers I guess there's no issue
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 21:22:56 - timcouwelier: personally, I don't mind using Mapillary
Sat, Jul 4, 2020, 21:23:13 - timcouwelier: but every now and then I'll let the osm-fr guys grab a copy of the images, jus in case.
Sun, Sep 13, 2020, 15:01:30 - Jonathan left the room
Wed, Sep 30, 2020, 20:00:59 - Thibaultmol: Mapillary now has made official support pages for the GoPro max (the successor to the Fusion).
Till now all we had to go on was some forum posts. I've asked them how in their opinion the Max performs vs the Fusion.
The fusion had some problems for this purpose, but so does the Max just different ones)
Wed, Sep 30, 2020, 20:01:03 - Thibaultmol: https://help.mapillary.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012674619-GoPro-MAX
Wed, Sep 30, 2020, 20:01:21 - Thibaultmol: And the guys at Trekview also made one of their advanced guides for every possible thing you want to map
Wed, Sep 30, 2020, 20:01:22 - Thibaultmol: https://guides.trekview.org/trek-pack/v2/kit-setup
Wed, Sep 30, 2020, 20:02:09 - Thibaultmol: Not sure if I've mentioned Trekview before but they basically are specialised in making these kits which make streeview capturing easier 
Wed, Sep 30, 2020, 20:05:23 - Thibaultmol: Their trekking kit (so stick on a backpack) which includes the gopro max itself and a spare battery costs 	¬£700 (770 euros)
(for context: gopro max without extra battery and accessories costs 479 euro on bol.com)
Wed, Sep 30, 2020, 20:20:16 - Thibaultmol: Plus they also made an eas(ier than Mapillary's?) desktop app for uploading: https://guides.trekview.org/mtp-desktop-uploader/overview
Haven't tried it myself
Fri, Oct 2, 2020, 10:11:02 - joost_schouppe: oh that's quite interesting!
Fri, Oct 2, 2020, 10:11:26 - joost_schouppe: timcouwelier: the people at WVI wanted a solution to feed Streetview in one fo, seems trekview offers that
Fri, Oct 2, 2020, 10:12:40 - joost_schouppe: I'm pretty happy with the command line uploader though; does good preprocessing and works on 10s of 1000s of pictures at a time
Mon, Oct 5, 2020, 13:06:50 - Thibaultmol: I asked the guys at trackview what they think of the GoPro fusion vs the GoPro Max:
https://twitter.com/trekview/status/1313053035598360577?s=19
Mon, Oct 5, 2020, 13:07:03 - Thibaultmol: > Fusion. Workflow is more tedious (slow, manual) but image quality benefits as a result. Plus you can find lots of good deals on barely used 2nd hand models on eBay.
Fri, Oct 23, 2020, 10:57:56 - Seppe: A few colleagues are finding their way to Mapillary üëçÔ∏è
Fri, Oct 23, 2020, 10:58:13 - Seppe: Nice results from walking with GoPro on a gimbal
Fri, Oct 23, 2020, 11:51:51 - joost_schouppe: 360?
Fri, Oct 23, 2020, 15:22:51 - Seppe: No, a Hero5 we already had for other purposes.
Fri, Oct 23, 2020, 15:23:38 - Seppe: https://www.mapillary.com/map/im/8Yrby3sAwXzeC9oa59uL9h
Tue, Oct 27, 2020, 13:19:22 - timcouwelier: so, WVI is getting both a fusion 360 and a max.
Tue, Oct 27, 2020, 13:19:32 - timcouwelier: (was told so by Bart Boute)
Tue, Oct 27, 2020, 13:20:34 - timcouwelier: https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=50.9934231&lng=3.1271689&z=17&pKey=Rn1wmogXiz3mkbCaov4CyK&focus=photo
Tue, Oct 27, 2020, 13:20:48 - timcouwelier: on topic of mounts - that's with a chest harness for the gopro, no gimbal.
Tue, Oct 27, 2020, 21:45:50 - Thibaultmol: So how would that work then?
(if someone with time (which I unfortunately don't have atm) wants to map some parts of their town/City that is part of the WVI. Do they contact their municipality to ask permission to borrow the gear? Or can only WVI personal use it?)
Mon, Nov 2, 2020, 13:24:16 - timcouwelier: Thibault - I can only refer you to Bart Boute by WVI - b.boute@wvi with that question.
Mon, Nov 2, 2020, 13:24:29 - timcouwelier: Feel free to mention I suggested him as contact.
Mon, Nov 2, 2020, 13:27:32 - timcouwelier: also - ed (from mapillary)'s response to joost's question was.. well, underwhelming to say the least.
Fri, Nov 6, 2020, 13:20:39 - Seppe: https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2020/11/05/introducing-the-quality-score.html
Fri, Nov 6, 2020, 13:22:38 - Seppe: (just before i saw thibaultmol already posted this in the main channel :-) )
Fri, Nov 6, 2020, 13:29:51 - Seppe: (for now?) only at high zoom levels, but still pretty neat
Fri, Nov 6, 2020, 14:28:57 - joost_schouppe: now I want to know everyon's avarage score :)
Fri, Nov 6, 2020, 15:34:10 - timcouwelier: i have a bunch of old low quality ones tbh so not getting my hopes up
Fri, Nov 6, 2020, 15:49:13 - Thibaultmol: 'the shame list' (I'll probably be pretty high as well cause my only footage is from my phone that doesn't have good stabilisation XD)
Fri, Nov 6, 2020, 15:51:21 - timcouwelier: now imagine filipc not getting a top tier rating...  and how he'd lash out over it
Fri, Nov 6, 2020, 15:52:31 - Thibaultmol: I mean, some of his images are kinda hazy sometimes (no offense to him though. With such coverage, can't hate on the guy XD)
Mon, Nov 9, 2020, 22:21:10 - joost_schouppe: https://www.reddit.com/r/openstreetmap/comments/jr5xgb/deploying_the_lowest_earth_orbit_satellite_to
Mon, Nov 9, 2020, 22:21:38 - joost_schouppe: Interesant! 
Mon, Nov 9, 2020, 22:24:10 - Thibaultmol: oh yeah, it's those same guys I  mentioned earlier at some point. That I heard on the geomob podcast
EDIT: https://thegeomob.com/podcast/episode-40
Mon, Nov 9, 2020, 22:33:11 - joost_schouppe: So you think they are looking to be bought by Mapillary? Or do you think they'll actually try to get imagery themselves? 
Mon, Nov 9, 2020, 22:33:44 - Thibaultmol: I think they'll stay independant 
Mon, Nov 9, 2020, 22:34:37 - joost_schouppe: Looking forward to try it out
Wed, Nov 11, 2020, 07:29:11 - Thibaultmol: Not relevant to openstreetmap, but just good to know i guess
9to5Google: Google tests ‚ÄòDriving Mode‚Äô that lets you add Street View images without 360-degree camera.
https://9to5google.com/2020/11/10/google-tests-driving-mode-that-lets-you-add-street-view-images-without-360-degree-camera/
Seems like Google is adding functionality like the mapillary mobile app so you can contribute imagery from your phone while driving
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:11:45 - Thibaultmol: Created shapes on the OSM Belgium mapillary organization for each arrondissement in West-flanders
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:11:47 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:12:14 - Thibaultmol: (figured it'd the best size (not too large, too small) for making data verification projects)
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:14:06 - joost_schouppe: I've got a previous dataset with all the bicycle parkings for Brussels, if you want to have an idea of what the generated data looks like. took a long while to get the data out though
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:17:38 - Thibaultmol: oh right yeah, the data subscriptions also use those shapes. 
Got a smaller shape on my own mapillary org that I did a data sub on at some point iirc
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:18:12 - Thibaultmol: Think I might rename the shapes... mapillary's interface is kinda stupid here ...

Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:18:25 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:18:51 - Thibaultmol: Guess "WVL Ieper Arrondissement" instead then?
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:22:36 - joost_schouppe: sure
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:22:58 - joost_schouppe: so you're looking into a different data verification project then - checking if mapillary AI made the right call?
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:23:27 - joost_schouppe: another cool project could be to try and empty this map: http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/#item=8300
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:23:34 - Thibaultmol: That's an idea I had yeah, 
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:23:42 - Thibaultmol: yeah, osmose errors is what my goal is to get down
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:24:34 - Thibaultmol: but still in talks with mapillary on exactly how much the verification projects impact it. (did a full verification project on fire hydrants in Aalter. And while it 'feels' like the amount has gone down. I still notice some that are on the map, which clearly aren't fire hydrants.
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:26:13 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:26:22 - Thibaultmol: Still waiting on a response for that last question
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:27:02 - Thibaultmol: But yeah, didn't know they had an api for that: https://www.mapillary.com/developer/api-documentation/#vote-for-an-object-detection
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:31:29 - joost_schouppe: <@thibaultmol:matrix.org "Still waiting on a response for ..."> I'm guessing that there is no easy way to return from "this image has this osm object" to the actual "mapillary recognized object type x in this specific spot of the image" - or if I read the rest correctly, the API is not ready to recieve this kind of info, only "some detections in this image were wrong"
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:35:33 - Thibaultmol: It seems that way, yeah. which is honestly stupid. Cause with Osmose, you got the perfect tool to report these wrong detections, yet it can't be properly impleneted
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:35:50 - Thibaultmol: it also just confuses how reporting the entire image as incorrect helps them that much...
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 08:37:00 - joost_schouppe: yeah, this is rather weird
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 10:21:53 - Thibaultmol: Interesting thing I noticed: seems like verification projects can go above org's.
(for example: I already did a couple verifications in Tielt for fire hydrants on a personal org I created. 
And those contributions also show up in the verification project I made in the osm belgium org)
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 17:18:15 - Thibaultmol: Got a reply regarding my question about osmose & mapillary
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 17:19:02 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 17:24:43 - joost_schouppe: makes sense
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 17:25:16 - joost_schouppe: also: a false positive from Osmose can also mean "this is in fact already mapped in OSM but you're not looking in the right place"
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 17:25:51 - Thibaultmol:  Wouldn't you in that case also press the green checkmark?
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 17:26:17 - joost_schouppe: oh would I?
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 17:26:58 - Thibaultmol: (I've been doing it that way üòÖ)
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 17:27:08 - joost_schouppe: hmm, I never did :)
Wed, Nov 18, 2020, 21:58:41 - Thibaultmol: Seppe:  did you make this one? https://pic4review.pavie.info/#/mission/1389
EDIT: nvm, was mine as wel
Fri, Nov 20, 2020, 08:24:31 - joost_schouppe: Pretty significant improvement in ID / Mapillary integration https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2020/11/19/latest-and-greatest-Mapillary-in-OSM-iD.html

Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 17:31:18 - Thibaultmol: * toont een foto van een samsung gear 360 XD
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 17:31:46 - Thibaultmol: Dus is dit voor intern? of zal het gedeeld worden via Mapillary of dergelijke?
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 18:14:40 - Seppe: that's the question
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 18:17:20 - joost_schouppe: Wie schrijft er naar interwaas? 
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:28:15 - Seppe: Ik wil wel een ontwerpje maken.
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:33:14 - joost_schouppe: Misschien kunnen we ook aan Wouter van wvi hulp vragen. 
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:33:28 - joost_schouppe: Die is van een gelijkaardig type organisatie
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:35:29 - joost_schouppe: Misschien moeten we dan ook contact opnemen met die Ward Schouppe
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:35:43 - joost_schouppe: (de journalist) 
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:36:22 - joost_schouppe: Afijn, eerst meer te weten komen. Staat beschreven als "internal use only", maar wie weet is het stiekem toch open
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:38:54 - Seppe: Ik probeer straks nog een aanzet te posten hier. 
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:41:20 - Seppe: terloops al: misschien goed als het vanuit OpenStreetMap Belgi√´ komt, dat geeft het wat meer cachet
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:45:17 - joost_schouppe: claro, maar je kan gerust een mailtje sturen in naam van osmbe
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:45:27 - joost_schouppe: alleh, als we 't hier samen eens bekeken hebben
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 19:59:55 - Seppe: :-)
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 21:11:31 - Seppe: Ok, snelle poging tussen heel wat andere zaken door: https://hackmd.io/@mVEUA341SZyjGH1Rao51kQ/SJ616mu9v/edit
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 21:12:52 - Seppe: Laat jullie maar gaan!
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 21:35:29 - Seppe: (of zeg me wat er aan scheelt, dan maak ik gerust zelf nog een nieuwe versie)
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 21:39:26 - joost_schouppe: yes; heb een paar details aangevuld
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 21:40:26 - joost_schouppe: good to go
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 23:42:08 - Seppe: ok, thanks
Sun, Nov 22, 2020, 23:42:09 - Seppe: mail sent
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:09:33 - joost_schouppe: https://www.mapillary.com/developer/api-documentation/
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:09:44 - joost_schouppe: ik heb toevallig net gebeld met Ed van Mapillary
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:10:00 - joost_schouppe: dus voor de duielijkheid: alle verkeersbordendetecties etc zijn ondertussen open data
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:10:47 - joost_schouppe: en volgens Ed is het nu dus perfect mogelijk om -bijvoorbeeld- een downloadsite te maken met alle detecties in een bepaald gebied, en die via de API van Mapillary regelmatig een download te laten doen
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:11:36 - Thibaultmol: Dus kan dan in een Pic4review  of maproullette challenge gestoken worden?
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:12:23 - joost_schouppe: yep, zou moeten lukken
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:12:32 - joost_schouppe: zoals dit he http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/#item=8300
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:13:06 - Thibaultmol: Dacht dat het al open data was eigenlijk aangezien dat een paar tools bepaalde borden al weergaven
Wed, Nov 25, 2020, 10:18:46 - joost_schouppe: dat soort toepassingen kon al langer, maar 't is voor 't eerst dat ik helemaal door heb dat alle detecties door iedereen voor om het even wat gebruikt mogen worden
Fri, Nov 27, 2020, 10:30:46 - Thibaultmol: Don't think it's been mentioned here before:
Openstreetcam is now called KartaView: https://blog.improveosm.org/en/2020/11/hello-kartaview/
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:13:08 - joost_schouppe: https://enot.publicprocurement.be/enot-war/preViewNotice.do?noticeId=390082&saveSearchParams=true&marketPlaceType=both&useWorkingOrganisationId=false&isPopup=&publicationDateBDAFrom=&advancedSearch=&contractTypeIds=3&publicationDateBDATo=&publicationNumberBDA=&d-446978-p=3&
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:13:24 - joost_schouppe: Blijkbaar komt er weer een hele databank, via Fluvius
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:38:18 - timcouwelier: maar Fluvius en open...
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:38:29 - timcouwelier: Infrax had nog een rioleringsdatabank waar studiebureaus aankonden
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:38:37 - timcouwelier: sinds de merge met Eandis is zelfs dat er niet meer
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:38:46 - timcouwelier: laat staan dat ze dit soort dingen open gaan ontsluiten.
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:39:07 - Thibaultmol: Ik begrijp niet hoe een instantie zoals Fluvius niet verplicht wordt om dat openbaar te maken eigenlijk... absurd gewoon..
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:41:14 - timcouwelier: raamcontract met looptijd van 96 maanden
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:41:19 - timcouwelier: YOINK
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:48:10 - timcouwelier: en 76 gemeentes omvat het
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:48:14 - timcouwelier: da's een flinke schaal.
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:48:44 - timcouwelier: iets zegt me ook dat het een stevige offerte wordt
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:50:53 - Thibaultmol: Kunnen we iets doen om toch te proberen dat ze dit openbaar maken?
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:51:44 - joost_schouppe: ik zal eens horen via okbe
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 14:51:59 - joost_schouppe: maar ik vrees van niet
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:00:37 - Thibaultmol: Dat we moeten betalen voor de diensten die Fluvius aanbiedt, uiteraard.
Maar deze beelden zijn al betaald, deels door Fluvius en deels door die gemeentes. Dus wat kunnen ze verliezen door het openbaar te maken... *sigh* 
Geraak daar echt kakge√Ørriteerd aan als dit soort zaken gebeuren...
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:01:34 - joost_schouppe: het probleem is dat overheid meestapt in de logica van die bedrijven
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:02:02 - joost_schouppe: "als jullie dit kopen en enkel raadpleegrechten krijgen, dan krijg je het veel goedkoper, want dan kunnen we het aan andere mensen ook verkopen"
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:03:09 - joost_schouppe: ik denk dat het enige werkbare alternatief in dat soort setting is dat je zegt "geef -geprviligeerde- toegang aan klanten, en 360¬∞ beelden aan iedereen"
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:03:30 - joost_schouppe: want ze kopen nu ook lidar en fijne tooltjes om met klik-op-kaart plaatsbepaling te doen etc
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:30:04 - timcouwelier: Eens een ballonetje oplaten..
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:30:15 - timcouwelier: kan OSM-be een deelnemer aan GDI-vlaanderen worden?
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:49:50 - joost_schouppe: hahaha, ah nice I like the way you think
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:50:22 - joost_schouppe: ik geloof dat we vanaf dan verpluicth zouden zijn om voor onze administratie crab adressen te gebruiken :D
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:52:49 - timcouwelier: It mean, I feel it's worth exploring the option.
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:53:23 - timcouwelier: https://www.geopunt.be/voor-experts/gdi-vlaanderen/voorwaarden
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:55:26 - joost_schouppe: Het samenwerkingsverband GDI-Vlaanderen omvat alle Vlaamse instanties.
Concreet betekent dit dat volgende instanties bij het samenwerkingsverband horen: 

    het Vlaams Parlement en de eraan verbonden instellingen; 
    de diensten, instellingen en rechtspersonen die afhangen van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap of het Vlaamse Gewest; 
    de gemeenten en de districten; 
    de provincies; 
    de andere gemeentelijke en provinciale instellingen, met inbegrip van de verenigingen zonder winstoogmerk waarin √©√©n of meer gemeenten of de provincies minstens de helft van de stemmen in √©√©n van de beheersorganen heeft of de helft van de financiering voor haar rekening neemt; 
    de verenigingen van provincies en gemeenten, bedoeld in de wet van 22 december 1986 betreffende de intercommunales, en de samenwerkingsvormen zoals geregeld in het decreet van 6 juli 2001 houdende de intergemeentelijke samenwerking; 
    de openbare centra voor maatschappelijk welzijn, hierna O.C.M.W.'s te noemen, en de verenigingen, bedoeld in hoofdstuk 12 van de organieke wet van 8 juli 1976 betreffende O.C.M.W.'s; 
    de polders, bedoeld in de wet van 3 juni 1957 betreffende de polders, en de wateringen, bedoeld in de wet van 5 juli 1956 betreffende de wateringen; 
    de kerkfabrieken en de instellingen die belast zijn met het beheer van de temporali√´n van de erkende erediensten; 
    alle andere instanties binnen het Vlaamse Gewest en de Vlaamse Gemeenschap. 

Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:57:36 - timcouwelier: dus van zodra er √©√©n gemeente ons sponsort voor de helft van ons 'werkingsbudget' (kan me niet inbeelden dat het veel is) voldoen we?
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:57:46 - joost_schouppe: maar misschien kunnen we wel als databron opgenomen worden, zie http://www.geopunt.be/~/media/geopunt/geowijzer/gdi/documenten/20180327_richtlijnen%20inzake%20toevoegingen%20aan%20de%20gdi.pdf (daar staat precies niet √©cht expliciet dat je GDI-deelnemer moet zijn om GDI-data toe kunnen voegen)
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:58:05 - joost_schouppe: <@timcouwelier:matrix.org "dus van zodra er √©√©n gemeente on..."> lol
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 15:59:13 - joost_schouppe: wel nogal veel verplichtingen hoor, ik weet niet zeker of dat fijn zou zijn. ik zou wel √©cht de gezichten bij AIV willen zien als we dat echt zouden aanvragen
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:03:54 - timcouwelier: misschien zijn er wel opinions nodig van de board, of het haalbaar is, en of het opportuun is.
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:04:15 - timcouwelier: maar als de verplichtingen meevallen, zou ik wel durven, lijkt me.
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:04:18 - timcouwelier: Al is het maar als statement.
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:04:57 - joost_schouppe: gaat fluvius met alle gdi-deelnemers delen eigenlijk?
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:05:09 - joost_schouppe: of enkel met wie ingetekend heeft (lijkt me logisch)
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:05:30 - timcouwelier: Fluvius meldt in de opdrachtdocumenten enkel intern gebruik denk ik
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:05:52 - timcouwelier: maar of ze die partijen gaan toestand dezelfde data aan te bieden aan anderen (gemeentes, ...) was me nog niet duidelijk
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:07:49 - timcouwelier: De opdracht wordt in de markt gezet door een aankoopcentrale. De lijst van de deelnemende lokale besturen vindt u terug in bijlage van deze aankondiging van opdracht. Sinds 2008 stelt Agentschap Informatie Vlaanderen (AIV) een viewer van de 360o beeldendatabank gratis ter beschikking aan de deelnemers GDI-Vlaanderen (o.a. lokale besturen, intercommunales). De databank is vergelijkbaar met Google Streetview, maar is recenter vastgelegd, dekt een groter gebied (inclusief kleine wegen, doodlopende straten) en heeft een betere resolutie en technologie die zorgt voor een grotere nauwkeurigheid van metingen.

De beelden in de databank zijn echter verouderd (2012-2014) en zijn aan vervanging toe. Het is bijgevolg noodzakelijk om een nieuwe beeldendatabank te laten cre√´ren.

De 360o beeldendatabank wordt binnen Fluvius dagelijks gebruikt om een eerste zicht te krijgen op een terreinsituatie bij diverse vragen, klachten van derden, het voorbereiden van een co√∂rdinatievergadering, ondersteunend te zijn bij ontwerpen (kleine werken en aansluitingswerken worden op basis van deze beelden ontworpen zonder verplaatsing) en opmaken van vergunningsaanvragen.

Daarnaast biedt het de mogelijkheid de migratie van geografische gegevens en inventarisatie van de openbare verlichting, luchtnet en bovengrondse assets te faciliteren alsook de datakwaliteit te verbeteren.

De beelden hebben ook nog potentieel (eventueel in combinatie met beeldherkenningsalgoritmes) in toepassingsgebieden dewelke op heden nog niet gebruikt worden bij Fluvius, zoals onder meer:

‚Äî Line of sight based producten (plaatsing sensoren, wifi, 5G),

‚Äî gebruik bij 3D ontwerpen van bovengrondse infrastructuur en as-built liggingsplannen,

‚Äî bepalen van de asset health (loodrechtheid van palen, laaghangende bovengrondse leidingen, [...]),

‚Äî conditie beoordeling wegenis.
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:11:27 - timcouwelier: 75pct of points is price, 10 pct for resolution/point cloud density, 10 pct for timing and 5 pct for quality of the visualisation software
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:11:42 - timcouwelier: right- nederlands.
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:14:32 - Seppe: Vaak worden in bestekken standaard bepalingen opgenomen over intellectuele eigendom. Stel nu dat ze in het bestek opnemen dat alle intellectuele eigendom moet worden overgedragen (staat er vaak standaard in) en de leverancier houdt daar geen rekening mee bij het indienen van de offerte, dan kunnen we de beelden achteraf opvragen op basis van het bestuursdecreet (stuk over hergebruik)
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:14:39 - Seppe: Maar misschien wel een beetje een long shot ...
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:16:47 - timcouwelier: ben aan't kijken of ik daar iets over terug kan vinden
Wed, Dec 2, 2020, 16:17:28 - timcouwelier: maar er staat geen fluit in - ze verwijzen voor alles naar een vragenlijst die moest opgevraagd worden bij de aankoopdienst
Tue, Dec 8, 2020, 21:01:48 - Seppe: https://twitter.com/seppe_santens/status/1336400479912386560

https://www.mapillary.com/map/im/biEreC30FSmTDjpVTo1ccW
Looks like a municipal account. Started in September and already 45k images, systematically doing every street in the inner city.
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 19:57:43 - Seppe: Does anyone know anything about this? Might serve as an example for other municipalities
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:43:30 - joost_schouppe: Oh cool, nope, didn't know! 
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:44:24 - timcouwelier: funny approach with the camera tilted a bit sideways
Wed, Dec 23, 2020, 20:44:28 - timcouwelier: to cover a wider view

Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:05:26 - joost_schouppe invited juminet
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:05:37 - joost_schouppe: Invited juminet to explain Mapillary data download
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:06:23 - joost_schouppe: 1) Have an Organization account
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:06:42 - joost_schouppe: You can make one yourself, but I've added you to https://www.mapillary.com/app/org/mosmbelgium
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:07:04 - joost_schouppe: (you can now also contribute your images "for" that organization, which is fun to show how strong we are on mapillary)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:07:16 - joost_schouppe: 2. Make a shape for the relevant area
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:07:36 - joost_schouppe sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:09:13 - joost_schouppe: in theory you can use the admin boundaries; in practice most of the time you need to draw the borders manually
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:09:28 - joost_schouppe: (at least I usually don't get it to use what I want)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:13:31 - joost_schouppe: then click on the shape and choose "subscribe to map data"
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:15:12 - joost_schouppe: Choose the traffic signs and subscribe to the data. You also need to select a plan. These "plans" used to be crazy expensive, but should now be auto approved
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:15:44 - joost_schouppe: https://www.mapillary.com/dashboard/org/mosmbelgium/shapes/Kjxsi9553r8FTspt9OuDY7
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:16:39 - joost_schouppe: When I tried it for Halle, it was auto approved real quick. But I used another organization (osmbelgium, not mosmbelgium), where we already have another data subscripiton.
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:16:50 - joost_schouppe: trafficsigns-all.geojson (Media omitted)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:16:57 - joost_schouppe: ^^ that's the data
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:18:04 - juminet joined the room
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:20:37 - joost_schouppe: hi juminet I hope you can see the history just above :)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:25:19 - joost_schouppe invited @thierry1030:matrix.org
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:25:27 - @thierry1030:matrix.org joined the room
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:26:42 - juminet: yes perfect! I'll go through it in a few minutes!
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:27:04 - joost_schouppe: I actually already did everything :)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:28:22 - joost_schouppe: it seems the subscription has been accepted already
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:30:53 - joost_schouppe: now the button to "request download" is finally apearing on that last link
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:31:32 - joost_schouppe: the page should show a downloadable file just like mine above in some time
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:31:43 - joost_schouppe: file is ready
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:32:14 - joost_schouppe: I also flagged "include osm way id", so you can easily link it to the road Mapillary thinks it applies to
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:41:25 - joost_schouppe: for styling in QGIS, I just got this very helpful suggestion (have't tried myself): https://forum.mapillary.com/t/style-for-downloaded-data/4669/3
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:58:55 - juminet: I got the download link but the zip file was empty (except a README). Will try later, the mapillary website is slow right now. 
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 13:59:38 - juminet: Also, I wonder if I have to do smthg to put my images inside the osm-be organisation? 
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:06:47 - joost_schouppe: trafficsigns-all.geojson (Media omitted)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:06:54 - joost_schouppe: works on my side
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:10:50 - juminet: thanks! Meanwhile I got it as well ;-)

Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:26:43 - juminet sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:34:44 - Thibaultmol: (might also be useful to note that there are already a bunch of WVL and OVL (west & oost flanders) arrondissement shapes .Those cover both provinces fully)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:35:10 - Thibaultmol: Didn't do the rest of flanders cause didn't know if these 'preset shapes' or however you want to call them were useful enough or would just clutter things
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:35:33 - joost_schouppe: <@juminet:matrix.org "He he cool"> you got it to work in QGIS?
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:39:58 - juminet: yes, thanks to your question on the mapillary support.
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:41:11 - juminet: But the coverage in Chastre is not very good (as OSM).
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:46:10 - juminet: They are really happy with that. I swear not promoting FB-Mapillary anymore back in June myself, but maybe I can do it today with the mapillary Champs-Libres account? Or is it too schizophrenic? ü§™
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:49:54 - joost_schouppe: maybe philipc wants to go there :)
Mon, Mar 1, 2021, 14:53:03 - joost_schouppe: if they dedicate someone to drive around the town in a car or bicycle, I can share the gopro
Fri, May 7, 2021, 13:55:47 - timcouwelier: I just noticed..
Fri, May 7, 2021, 13:55:54 - timcouwelier: Wouter Verhelst is no longer working at WVI
Fri, May 7, 2021, 13:56:10 - timcouwelier: is now 'afdelingshoofd ruimte' at gemeente Wingene
Fri, May 7, 2021, 14:09:30 - Thibaultmol: Oh, nov 2020 he was still working on the streetplan for Ruiselede. huh
Fri, May 7, 2021, 14:37:15 - timcouwelier: its since april 2021
Thu, Jun 3, 2021, 10:37:43 - timcouwelier: De vervanger voor Wouter Verhelst is bekend - Ine De Cubber (vroeger GIS-ambtenaar bij Zulte)
Thu, Jun 3, 2021, 10:39:09 - timcouwelier: Heeft alleszins ook al wat met Mapillary zitten testen, herinner ik me :)
Thu, Nov 4, 2021, 15:03:46 - Seppe: In Vlaams Brabant hebben ze blijkbaar ook wat zitten experimenteren met streetview beelden, maar niet echt op de manier die wij zouden kiezen. Enfin, voor wie een uurtje of 7 wil chillen:

Thu, Nov 4, 2021, 15:07:18 - joost_schouppe: mijn god
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 17:12:41 - joost_schouppe: Ik heb vandaag let Bart Boute van wvi gebeld over 360¬∞ camera's. Heel interessant! Blijkbaar hebben ze zowel een GoPro max als een GoPro fusion gekocht. Qua specs is de fusion beter, maar qua post-processing is de max easy en de fusion nogal intensief. Daardoor hebben ze de fusion nog nooooit gebruikt. Ik heb, met mijn gekende subtiliteit, gesuggereerd om "iemand als Tim Couwelier ofzo" daar eens mee te laten experimenteren. Hij ging het eens voorleggen. Benieuwd :)
Alleszins heel interessant om hun ervaringen eens te horen
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 17:13:53 - timcouwelier: subtiel.
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 17:14:08 - joost_schouppe: That's my style
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 17:20:48 - joost_schouppe: WVI zou het bijzonder appreci√´ren als we wat zouden communiceren over hoe cool het is dat zij aan die open straatbeelden werken. Blijkbaar hebben ze al een hoop industriegebieden in 360 gedaan. Heb gezegd dat dat goed is, als ze ergens iets afgerond hebben ofzo. Maar dat ik nog liever iets zou doen met osm, type "dankzij de beelden van wvi zijn nu alle bedrijven in kaart gebracht". 
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 17:21:41 - joost_schouppe: Tenslotte hebben ze zelf nog niet ontdekt hoe ze gederiveerde data uit mapillary kunnen trekken. Dat is mij wel al eens gelukt, we moeten dat eens terug oppikken en documenteren
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 17:45:59 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "That's my style"> een nee hebt ge, een ja kunde krijgen. Well done Joost! üëçÔ∏èüòÄ
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 18:47:16 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Tenslotte hebben ze zelf nog nie..."> kunt ge hier wat voorbeelden van geven? ik moet spontaan denken aan de (automatische) herkenning van verkeersborden ...
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 18:50:06 - joost_schouppe: Awel ja, on eerste instantie dat. Maar ze doen ook "object detectie", bijvoorbeeld fietsenstallingen, borduren, riooldeksels, zebrapaden 
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 18:54:31 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Awel ja, on eerste instantie dat..."> juist ja. Dat kan ik me nog (vaag) herinneren. is er daarover ook niet begin dit jaar een maproulette (of iets dergelijks) geweest?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 18:55:08 - joost_schouppe: Mmmm niet dat ik mij herinner
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 18:56:11 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: jawel, dat was zo'n proefproject waarin we moesten bevestigen of de object detectie correct was gebeurd of niet
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 18:56:25 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: ik herinner me nog iets met fietsenstallingen
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 18:56:38 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: en dan moesten we aangeven als de capaciteit wel juist was of niet
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 18:57:05 - joost_schouppe: Ha dat kan, klinkt me vaagbekend
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 19:11:08 - joost_schouppe: https://help.mapillary.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026122412-GoPro-Fusion-360
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 19:12:09 - joost_schouppe: Hier gedetailleerd artikeltje over de fusion, die mapillary zelf het meeste aanraadt. Grote voordeel is 2 foto's per seconde, grote nadeel is zware rekenwerk achteraf om alle fotootjes te verwerken tot echte 360 beelden
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 19:13:38 - joost_schouppe: Die van Vansteeland hadden vooral wat werk met de foto's aan begin en einde van de sessie weg te gooien (dubbels verwijderen). In principe kan de command line tool dat ook, maar heb ik nog nooit getest. Wel horen zeggen dat die te veel delete als je scherpe bochten neemt
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 19:16:00 - joost_schouppe: Haja, en nadeel van de fusion is dat die niet meer gemaakt wordt, lol
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 20:20:12 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Hier gedetailleerd artikeltje ov..."> ik zou dat wel graag eens in de praktijk willen zien hoe dat die "verwerking" juist gebeurt ... vooraleer ik foto's upload (uiteraard niet in 360¬∞), kijk ik ze ook allemaal na om te zien of er niet onnodig dubbels in zitten of andere zaken die er niet in thuis horen ...
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 20:21:26 - joost_schouppe: Ja, ik ga eens een experimentje doen denk ik daarmee
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 20:22:32 - joost_schouppe: Ondertussen nog wat verder gelezen over die 360 cameras en dju toch t is een lastig thema. Eigenlijk moet je gewoon euh kiezen voor iets dat niet geweldig is, omdat er geen echt goede oplossingen zijn
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 20:57:32 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: mss dan eerst nog een andere fundamentelere vraag als advocaat van de duivel: kunt ge in een notendop aangeven wat voor u de grote meerwaarde (met inachtneming van de beperkingen) is van 360¬∞-beelden en waarom we hier best toch blijven op inzetten/over nadenken?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:01:14 - joost_schouppe: Euh, eigenlijk nog het meeste in intu√Øtieve bruikbaarheid denk ik. Ik denk dat 360 een minimumvereiste is voor veel eindgebruikers. Anders is de overstap van Google Street view en het oude Vlaamse product te groot
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:03:12 - joost_schouppe: Eigenlijk zijn vier gewone gopro's ook goed. Die foto's worden zelf binnen mapillary redelijk ook gestitched. Maar als je met maar √©√©n camera gaat, dan kan je enkel "rondkijken" door naar heel andere foto's over te gaan. Dat werkt in de praktijk ook niet echt gemakkelijk. 
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:03:39 - joost_schouppe: Je hebt ook dubbel zo veel werk, omdat je elke straat minstens twee keer af moet gaan
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:04:43 - joost_schouppe: Ik denk wel dat als ik het zelf zou doen, ik zou proberen met de gopro max + een gewone gopro voor hogere resolutie frontale beelden
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:04:56 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: ok
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:05:02 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: andere vraag:
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:05:13 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: voor wie zijn in (eerste instantie) de foto's bedoeld?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:05:36 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: voor mappers? of is het ook nodig/is er een nood om "anderen" de overstap te laten maken?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:05:41 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: wegbeheerders?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:06:10 - joost_schouppe: Voor minstens de helft als een proof of concept, om anderen to overtuigen ook bij te dragen
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:06:36 - joost_schouppe: Zoals gemeentebesturen of wegbeheerders, maar ook toeristische organisaties etc
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:06:44 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: bijdragen in het aanleveren van foto's? of bijdragen in het verbeteren van de data/kaart?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:07:02 - joost_schouppe: Die foto's zelf in eerste instantie
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:07:23 - joost_schouppe: Zodat we komen tot gebiedsdekkende, recente, open straatbeelfotografie
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:07:50 - joost_schouppe: Mijn lokaal-bestuur-petje zou daar heel blij mee zijn 
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:08:20 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: "gebiedsdekkende, recente, open straatbeelfotografie" -> lijkt me een mooie visie ...
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:08:39 - joost_schouppe: Anderzijds kunnen we met onze proefprojectjes ook leuke osm projecten doen, om zo meer mensen aan boord te krijgen voor osm zelf
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:09:09 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: dat is waar ja
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:10:12 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: voor die gemeenten (Ham, Oostrozebeke, Waasland) die volledig in mapillary met 360¬∞ gedekt zijn ... is dat een one-shot geweest? of hebben zij opzet om dat op regelematige basis te herhalen?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:10:38 - joost_schouppe: Bij mijn weten one shot
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:10:45 - joost_schouppe: Maar geen idee eigenlijk 
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:10:54 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: ok
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:11:56 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: algemeen gesteld is dat een beetje mijn 'frustratie' bij overheidsprojecten ... dat het telkens over 'one shot-projecten' gaat ...
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:12:39 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: terwijl een 'beheer van wegen/data/enz)' net veronderstelt iets 'continu' te zijn ...
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:13:05 - joost_schouppe: Goh ja. In die zin is mapillary al geweldig
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:13:36 - joost_schouppe: Je doet een one shot met een serieuze inspanning. En stuurt dan iemand met een smartphone of een GoPro op plaatsen waar je weet dat iets veranderd is
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:14:01 - joost_schouppe: Of tijdens de one shot leidt je wat vrijwilligers op, die het dan hopelijk rustig blijven bijwerken
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:14:27 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Of tijdens de one shot leidt je ..."> dit is natuurlijk niet 'duurzaam' (in de tijd)

Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:18:17 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: laatste vraag
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:18:19 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: strategisch
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:18:37 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: er zijn nu die gemeenten met die one-shot dekking

Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:19:06 - joost_schouppe: Niet in detail
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:19:13 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: in West-Vlaanderen is WVI de katalysator geweest als ik me niet vergis
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:19:32 - joost_schouppe: Maar het was een goedkope optie bij Vansteelandt als je daar een veel rijker product kocht
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:19:37 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: dienen we dat op √©√©n of andere manier te "faciliteren/promoten"?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:19:51 - joost_schouppe: En ja, in West Vlaanderen dankzij lobbywerk wvi neem ik aan

Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:21:27 - joost_schouppe: Maar ja, dat van Ham vind ik een heel goede case om iets mee te doen. Contact opnemen, bedanken, en osm data verzamelen in hun gemeente 
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:21:36 - joost_schouppe: Niet hip genoeg, te duur
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:21:54 - joost_schouppe: Digitaal Vlaanderen zit al jaren in besparingsmodus
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:21:59 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: I see
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:22:07 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: van wanneer dateert de "dood" juist?
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 21:22:20 - joost_schouppe: Goh euh, 2019 denk ik

Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 23:20:34 - Seppe: Als ze nog geen gebiedsdekkende maxspeed kaart hebben, dan lijkt me dat wel een mooie opener. Is op zich niet zo heel veel werk of heel complex en is ook leuk om te vergelijken met de automatisch gegenereerde versie van Vlaanderen
Wed, Dec 22, 2021, 23:20:53 - Seppe: Kan perfect de aanvullende waarde van human mappers aantonen.

Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 07:09:18 - timcouwelier: Maar het systeem wat Vlaanderen dekte is inderdaad stopgezet 
Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 07:09:34 - timcouwelier: Dat gaf gemeentes de optie :
Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 07:09:57 - timcouwelier: Ofwel intekenen op een contract (per gemeente) met de originele data-aanbieder 
Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 07:10:05 - timcouwelier: En dat was vrij stevig qua prijs 
Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 07:10:17 - timcouwelier: Ofwel zonder beelden verder doen 
Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 07:10:26 - timcouwelier: Of kijken naar derde partijen 
Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 07:11:28 - timcouwelier: Een aantal mogelijke private aanbieders hebben zich in die markt gezet, waaronder vansteeland 
Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 07:12:03 - timcouwelier: Er is vorig jaar ergens door fluvius een brief gestuurd aan alle gemeentes waar ze werkzaam zijn

https://www.s-lim.be/nieuws/google-maps-voor-limburg-maar-dan-handiger-in-gebruik
1) ‚Äús-Lim, in 2017 opgericht door Nuhma en Fluvius, is de instantie van de Limburgse gemeenten die er moet voor zorgen dat Limburg mee is in het verhaal van de smart cities/regions‚Äù
2) ‚ÄúEr staan voorlopig vier rubrieken op de slimme kaart. In het hoofdstuk ‚Äòmobiliteit‚Äô kun je opzoeken waar je de auto of fiets kunt parkeren, waar je deelauto‚Äôs vindt, wanneer de bus komt en hoe druk het verkeer is.‚Äù
3) ‚ÄúOnder de categorie ‚Äòmilieu‚Äô kan men via de slimme kaart kijken waar de glasbollen staan. ‚ÄúDit is geen lijst, maar een informaticakoppeling. Als men ergens een bak verplaatst, wordt die informatie ook meteen aangepast‚Äù, zegt Neyens.‚Äù
4) ‚ÄúIn de rubriek ‚Äòveiligheid en welzijn‚Äô kunnen gemeenten laten zien waar veiligheidscamera‚Äôs hangen. ‚ÄúHet is de autonomie van de gemeenten om te beslissen of ze dat willen laten zien of niet. In deze rubriek kun je ook ontdekken waar de AED-toestellen hangen.‚Äù

Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:03:34 - joost_schouppe: ik moet zeer binnenkort schijven kopen of beginnen wissen (afijn, heb al wat gewist)
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:04:05 - joost_schouppe: ik was aan het denken om gewoon draagbare hdd te doen, of een oude PC met plaats voor een paar schijven als backup-machientje te gebruiken
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:04:27 - joost_schouppe: een tape drive zou wellicht nog het goedkoopste zijn :)
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:08:12 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: ter info: in functie van meetfiets-opdrachten moeten wij jaarlijks heel wat fotomateriaal ter beschikking stellen van onze klanten (provincies, Vlaamse Waterweg enz). Hiervoor hebben we vorig jaar een server opgezet waarop we onze foto's uploaden en via FileZilla kunnen de klanten dan de foto's downloaden. Het lijkt me wel nuttig om ook een dergelijk systeem op te zetten. Dan zijn de foto's ook op 1 plek (off line) gecentraliseerd ... en moeten we niet met harde schijven zitten sleuren ...
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:13:18 - joost_schouppe: en als ik dan de camera uitleen, dan sturen mensen naar die server en moet de serverbeheerder verder doorsturen naar mapillary?
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:13:51 - joost_schouppe: (ik moet altijd denken dat de bandbreedte van een postduif niet te verslaan is)

Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:16:52 - joost_schouppe: ja ok, in die situatie zou de fotograaf dus twee keer over internet foto's sturen?

Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:19:45 - joost_schouppe: anders moet je drie keer zo veel data over internet sturen
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:19:58 - joost_schouppe: een keer naar mapillary, een keer naar de server, en iemand moet op de server ontvangen
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:20:52 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: ok, hoe ziet gij het concreet in uw ideaal scenario?
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:23:38 - joost_schouppe: we hebben een centrale server met heel veel plaats. Samen met de camera geven we opslag mee van een terra of twee (afhankelijk van project). We vragen of ze aub hun foto's zelf willen uploaden (of op zijn minst opkuisen). Als ze klaar zijn, geven ze alles weer mee. In het slechtste geval doen wij de upload. Wij houden de foto's bij op onze server, en wissen het draagbaar medium voor de volgende vrijwilliger
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:24:26 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: ok
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:24:51 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: kleine verduidelijking: gij hebt het nu concreet over de foto's die genomen worden met de GoPro van OSM BE 
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:25:42 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: in mijn "denkoefening" zitten alle fotomakers die momenteel in mapillary uploaden onder de groep "OSM Belgium members"
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:26:31 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: en Philippe Casteleyn reken ik eigenlijk ook bij in "deze denkoefening"
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:27:04 - joost_schouppe: ah, da's iets anders. Dan zou 't natuurlijk wel cool zijn mochten we die kunnen binnentrekken. Al zijn we dan op zich opnieuw aan het uitvinden wat OSMFR al heeft. Die hebben een server waar je tegen kan zeggen "haal via de api van mapillary al mijn foto's binnen"
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:27:21 - joost_schouppe: maar goed, ik weet niet wat die daar mee uitsteken en er staat denk ik ook nergens veel documentatie over
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:27:57 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: "haal via de api van mapillary al mijn foto's binnen" -> ah bon, ik wist niet dat in theorie/in principe NU al kon ...
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:28:51 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: misschien dan eens navraag doen bij OSM FR hoe het daarmee zit?
Tue, Feb 1, 2022, 17:30:24 - joost_schouppe: yep yep, doe maar :)

Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:35:49 - Thibaultmol: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "mja, via telenet zal uploaden oo..."> HDD's die erin zitten zijn klein en oud. Dus die gaat ik crushen en wegsmijten. Nieuwe grote in steken. Daarmee dan ik me afvroeg hoeveel storage we nodig hebben hiervoor. 
Had graag iets gedaan met IPFS zodat we een soort van systeem konden hebben waarbij we een soort van virtuele raid hebben (Jij hebt een terabyte vrij. iemand heeft nog een terabyte of 2 vrij enz. Zodat er duplicaten zijn over meerdere locaties volledig automatisch. En via IPFS dat automatisch ook CDN beschikbaar.
Maar IPFS clusters zijn nog niet 100% klaar denk ik, en niet gebruiksvriendelijk genoeg.)
Met iets als Syncthing kunnen we natuurlijk wel iets doen. Maar dan moet het eerder manueel gebeuren bv.
Dus dat we de bestanden indelen in mappen met maximale grote. En dan een spreasheet waarmee we bijhouden wie welke folders helpt dupliceren/backupen via syncthing.
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:39:45 - joost_schouppe: Ik heb werkelijk geen idee wat je hier allemaal zegt :) -- maar ik heb wel een redelijk accuut probleem dat ik wat storage nodig heb. Dus als ik nu eens een schijf koop, die vol zet met al mijn bestanden, die schijf per postduif opstuur, en dan doe jij er je ding mee? De vraag is dan vooral: mag dat een doodgewone inbouw-HDD zijn? Of moet dat iets specifieks zijn?
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:41:44 - Thibaultmol: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Ik heb werkelijk geen idee wat j..."> Misschien beter dat ik schijven koop op naam van de apotheek (heh..), en een paar jaar gratis lid ben van osmbe ipv jaarlijke donatie?
Komt beter uit als ik de hardware met bedrijf koop dan privepersoon
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:42:02 - joost_schouppe: lid van osmbe is sowieso gratis :)
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:42:21 - Thibaultmol: Maar voor praktisch gewijs een hardeschijf die we heen en weer sturen voor de data kan natuurlijk. 
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:42:37 - joost_schouppe: awel ja, nu gewoon voor die giga backlog waar ik van af moet
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:42:48 - joost_schouppe: eens de boel draait, kunnen we het natuurlijk anders beginnen doen
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:43:13 - joost_schouppe: ik heb nu een paar aankopen gedaan voor osmbe, ik vraag me af of we dat dan niet beter via okbe vzw hadden gedaan
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:43:15 - joost_schouppe: soit
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:45:42 - Thibaultmol: aangezien de server nog niet draait kan ik alles tijdelijk dumpen op een van mijn synology's. Zitten in elk 4 schijven die met raid6 geconfigureerd zijn (dus helft van de schijven kunnen falen en we hebben nog steeds alle data)
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:46:48 - Thibaultmol: hoeveel data is het nu dat je kwijt moet?
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 14:53:54 - joost_schouppe: ben effe aan het tellen :)
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:02:53 - joost_schouppe: nog altijd aan het tellen, zit ondertussen aan 3400 gig
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:03:53 - Thibaultmol: Btw, sidenote: wie bij OKBE heeft Cloud68 gekozen voor de hosting van de bigbluebutton enz?
(ben aan het overwegen over te schakelen naar Bitwarden en Nextcloud en zou eventueel met Cloud68 werken. Wou eens horen of men tevreden is over hen)

Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:04:51 - Thibaultmol: 5.4TB op de ene synology en de rest op de andere
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:06:02 - joost_schouppe: <@thibaultmol:matrix.org "Btw, sidenote: wie bij OKBE heef..."> kan je best eens aan Jonathan vragen. OSMF werkt daar ook mee.
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:07:00 - joost_schouppe: ok ja, veel meer dan 4 tera zal het wel niet zien. Dan is vooral de vraag: hoe krijgen we dat daar?
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:17:34 - joost_schouppe: 3650 gig
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:32:01 - Thibaultmol: Dus de beste oplossing is een SSD in een usb enclosure.
- **PLUS** Geen probleem kqua transport, kan tegen alle stoten zolang het maar niet gebogen wordt.
- **MIN** Kost veel meer dan een gewone HDD (4TB kost 328 euro op dit moment. 8TB 629 euro. Ik kijk enkel naar Samsung, aangezien zij de enige echte betrouwbare zijn in ogen. Andere firma's liegen soms in hun specificaties)

Andere oplossing is een gewone HDD. Er zijn rugged casen, maar het is waarschijnlijk beter om een normale encslure te steken in een soort van foam doos.
- **PLUS** Goedkoper (16TB Seagate Exos (maar ben nog niet zeker of die goed is voor zoveel vibraties met shipping enz) kost 285 euro.)
- **MIN** Meer kans op dataverlies door schijf die kaputsch gaat. Zeker als het zo vaak heen en weer geshipped wordt. Zelfs met foam enz errond.
- **PLUS** Kan natuurlijk wel veel meer gegevens op dan bij een SSD  (bestaan nog niet in zo'n grote capaciteit)

Laatste oplossing is uploaden naar mijn server. 4TB zou op een connectie van 35mbps up (wat volgens mij gemiddeld is voor belgie mogelijks) 10 dagen duren, (uiteraard zou je dan iets moeten gebruiken dat geen last heeft van connectieonderbrekingen zoals Syncthing)
Dus dat laatste is moelijk, afhankelijk van hoeveel data het is en hoe traag de upload is. Maar daar zitten we in Belgie jammer genoeg redelijk slecht, tenzij je fiber hebt.
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:33:52 - joost_schouppe: bij upload heb je ook nog het probleem dat mijn "telent unlimited" helemaal niet zo unlimited is
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:34:06 - Thibaultmol: dat is ook waar
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:34:19 - Thibaultmol: Ik betaal voor telenet business (jammer genoeg) en daar heb je wel echte unlimited
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:34:27 - Thibaultmol: Maar dat voel je natuurlijk $$
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:34:35 - joost_schouppe: ken je hier geen goeie apotheek in de buurt? :D
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:35:56 - joost_schouppe: ik voel gelijk het meest voor die SSD van 4 tera. E√©n keer hier laten toekomen, dan naar jou, en dan naar de volgende grootbijdrager. Als ik dan de GoPro uitleen, dan kan ik nog altijd een eigen wat kleiner schijfje meegeven om een en ander te overbruggen
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:37:23 - Thibaultmol: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "ken je hier geen goeie apotheek ..."> Om over te nemen zodat ik dichter bij u ben? XDD
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:37:35 - joost_schouppe: lol
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:37:48 - joost_schouppe: nee, als die allemaal zo'n goei verbinding hebben kan ik misschien van daaruit uploaden :D
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:38:29 - Thibaultmol: Technisch gezien werken meeste apotheken in Belgie met de groothandel Febelco, waar apotheken ook pakketjes met elkaar kunnen uitwisselen. Op dit moment gratis maar binnenkort betalend. Wel massaal goedkoper dan de bposts en postNLs. Maar ja, Bedoeling is niet de apotheek een pakjes dienst wordt. Ik heb er geen probleem mee, maar is eerder de apotheek in jouw buurt XD
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:38:39 - Thibaultmol: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "nee, als die allemaal zo'n goei ..."> Oh I doubt that XD
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:38:50 - Thibaultmol: Meeste apotheken hebben gewoon basic internet
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:39:57 - Thibaultmol: Merk je bv ook regelmatig van de posts op social media van 'apotheken die tijdelijk gesloten zijn want internet ligt plat'.
Ik heb dat probleem niet. Wij hebben Telenet business als hoofdlijn, met automatische failover naar een basic proximus lijn. En dan een 3G modem die ik kan ingang steken mocht het echt nodig zijn.
(die laatste 2 ga ik ooit wel vervangen door EDPNet aangezien zij 4G backup ingebouwd hebben)
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:43:43 - joost_schouppe: ik denk dat ik weet aan wie dat het ligt dat het bij jullie stevig is :)
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:44:00 - Thibaultmol: yep XD
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:44:39 - Thibaultmol: Altijd zeer grappig als een grote firma plat ligt omdat hun internet niet werkt.. Meeste denken niet na (of weten het gewoon niet).
maar het is goedkoper om 2 providers te hebben vaak, dan 1 provider met een 'business backup lijn'.
gangster prijzen voor die backup lijnen 
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:44:42 - joost_schouppe: maar euh, wat ook nog een optie is, misschien goedkoper: toch gewoon een HDD die ooit bij jou in de server geduwd kan worden, als ik die eens persoonlijk kan afgeven. Dat is de goedkoopste oplossing
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:46:25 - Thibaultmol: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "maar euh, wat ook nog een optie ..."> Goed idee! Zal dan van de week nog eens nadenken over welke schijven ik in de server zal steken. 
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:46:44 - Thibaultmol: Weet je al ongeveer hoeveel GB elke minuut of uur aan gopro beelden is?
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:46:56 - Thibaultmol: (om een idee te hebben van hoeveel opslag we over de jaren zouden nodig hebben voor osmbe)
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 15:49:00 - joost_schouppe: die foto'tjes van de 360 zijn amper 3.2 mb per stuk en je kan er maar om de 2 seconden een nemen. Dus ongeveer 5.700 mb per uur

Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 16:10:50 - timcouwelier: Kan de GoPro een heel eind mee overweg 
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 16:12:05 - Thibaultmol: Het gaat natuurlijk over kleine hoeveelheid, dus dan is  SD geen probleem. Zelfs 1TB sd kaart.
Maar mocht het over 10TB of meer gaan zijn echte SSD's beter euro/GB
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 16:12:52 - Thibaultmol: (Sandisk microsdxc 1TB 0,159 euro/GB. 4TB samsung ssd: 0,079 euro/GB)
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 16:13:21 - Thibaultmol: is voor eindgebruiker natuurlijk ook gemakkelijker dat ze gewoon de gevulde sd kaartjes kunnen opsturen zonder er zelfs iets te moeten aan doen.
Thu, Feb 3, 2022, 16:15:56 - Thibaultmol: Ik weet nog niet of de verwerkingen gebeurd bij u of door eindgebruiker? 
Ik veronderstel door u of door ik, want is soms wat ingewikkeld.
En indien de verwerking/uploading gebeurd door een van ons: hoe zorgen we dan dat het op de mapillary account van hen komt? (uiteraard onder de osmbe org op mapillary)
Want ik vrees dat we moet kiezen tussen:
- Wij uploaden onder een gezamelijke account onder de mapillary org
- Wij vragen voor hun credentials (wat natuurlijk riskanter is op van veiligheid), maar misschien is het mogelijk om via hun api en Oauth te werken zodat we gewoon als een applicatie werken die tijdelijk toegang krijgt, zonder dat ze hun passwoord moeten delen. maar vrees dat dat niet zal lukken op mapillary)

Heb gezien dat als je met de mapillary tools authenticate dat je een config bestand krijgt met een token. Dus in principe kan iemand wel die mapillary tools exe downloaden, authenticaten met zijn/haar passwoord. En die token doorsturen ipv passwoord

- User knows how to use all the tools or is willing to learn to use the documentation (but isn't afraid command lines) - Upload using his own account to the org
- User knows how to use all the tools or is willing to learn to use the documentation (but isn't afraid command lines) BUT doesn't want to spend their bandwidth on uploading - They give us their login or use mapillary_tools to generate token - We upload to their account using their login/token under the org
- User wants to fully handoff all the work to us - They give us their login or use mapillary_tools to generate token - We upload to their account using their login/token under the org

Fri, Feb 11, 2022, 19:13:35 - joost_schouppe: The OSMBE 360 GoPro was presented at the Fietsersbond Halle yesterday. Dirk Dedoncker is doing mobility projects in Lierde and Pepingen, and will probably mapillarize most roads in both municipalities. He was enthused enough that he gave me 14.000 pictures already from a ride today (with his own regular GoPro).

> I was able to use the GoPro Max in time lapse / 0.5 second interval. However it records to GoPro video format; 2 frames per second. I used the GoPro app to convert to MP4, then was able to extract and geotag the images. The processing chain is awkward with a custom geotag program so I haven‚Äôt bothered to document the workflow. The advantage over photo timelapse is that the GoPro app can do horizon leveling.

Thu, Feb 17, 2022, 11:51:39 - Thibaultmol: Was dus inderdaad zo dat je wel degelijk kon 0.5 360timelapse maken, maar enkel als video (wat natuurlijk grote impact heeft op kwaliteit veronderstel ik)
Thu, Feb 17, 2022, 16:20:27 - Thibaultmol: 
Q: Slaan we de beelden als originelen op op mijn server? (enkel toegankelijk door mij en een paar beheerders van osmbe stel ik voor). Encrypted at rest natuurlijk.
Of is er daar een GDPR probleem mee? 

(is natuurlijk ook mogelijk om de foto's deels automatisch te blurren... waarmee ik dus bedoel dat we 'for the time being' the originelen laten staan. Ik heb al een script gevonden die claimed om gezichten te blurren: https://github.com/ORB-HD/deface/
Dan hebben we enkel nog iets nodig wat nummerplaten kan blurren.
Nadat die scripts gedraaid hebben kan ik dan met een diff(erential) programma kijken of er niks verkeerd is geblurred, zodat we 100% zeker zijn dat er geen data verloren gaat.
En dan uiteindelijk de originelen verwijderen)
Thu, Feb 17, 2022, 16:21:42 - Thibaultmol: (Er is ook dit script die ik vond, maar is al 3 jaar niet meer geupdate. Is van een firma die dit commerciaal doet, dus kan natuurlijk zijn dat hun 'open source versie' niet echt spetterend is
https://github.com/understand-ai/anonymizer )
Heb die laatste nog niet uitgeprobeerd, maar kan nu al zeggen dat ze hun proprietary model downloaden van Google Drive, maar die bestanden zijn niet meer toegang, misschien met opzet, misschien perongeluk)
Thu, Feb 17, 2022, 16:31:01 - joost_schouppe: Volgens mij is er enkel een probleem als je de foto's publiceert
Thu, Feb 17, 2022, 16:31:07 - joost_schouppe: Ik zou ze dus ongeblurd bijhouden
Thu, Feb 17, 2022, 16:31:46 - joost_schouppe: Als er ooit iemand ze wil van ons krijgen en publiceren, dan moeten zij aantonen dat ze dat oplossen, of moeten wij het op voorhand oplossen
Sun, Feb 20, 2022, 14:00:08 - joost_schouppe: thibaultmol: thierry1030 heeft ook ongeveer 1 terra aan foto's om te archiveren. Ik zou voorstellen: we kopen een SD kaartje (of meerdere?) aan een volume van 1 terra ongeveer, en versturen dan per post naar jou. Dan kunnen we die SD kaartjes dan ook gebruiken voor volgende GoPro gebruikers
Sun, Feb 20, 2022, 14:01:30 - joost_schouppe: Heb je aankoopadvies wat betreft die kaartjes? ik denk best toch enkele van 256 ofzo, dan zijn het er niet te veel, EN kan je ze nog relatief veilig in de GoPro zelf gebruiken (want die crashen wel eens in de gopro, en de verleiding is te groot om dan alle foto's daar gewoon op te laten staan)
Sun, Feb 20, 2022, 18:05:15 - Thibaultmol: In de doc heb ik al wat geschreven ivm de sd kaartjes.
TL;DR: Via sortering op Tweakers. net bleek de beste prijs/GB een kaarjte te zijn van Sandisk van 400GB.
> Assuming each 360 photo is 3.2MB. 400GB(x1024 for MB‚Äôs) / 3.2MB = 128k photos on that sd card.
> 128k / 30 (#photos each minute) / 60 (" each hour) = 71 hours on a 400GB sd card. For 90% of people who borrow the camera, that should be enough.

Wel van een website waar ik nog nooit van gehoord heb maar swat, volgens tweakers 31 positieve reviews: https://www.dataio.nl/sandisk-ultra-microsdxc-400gb-card-only/
Sun, Feb 20, 2022, 18:06:19 - Thibaultmol: En dus ook aangeraden om een aantal te kopen(stuk of 4 of 6). 
> We have two sd cards with the idea that we make a copy of all the files and send them trough different methods. (one with the original kit, one in an envelop to Thibault for storing on the server). Once Thibault has a couple sd cards, he can send them back to Joost or whoever manages the kit.

Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 13:22:47 - joost_schouppe: Yes, I think it would be fine to share here, he just does not want publicity. I'll ask first though 
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 13:23:08 - joost_schouppe: And yep, the gopro itself is already here. Just missing some parts to get started

Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 19:43:40 - joost_schouppe: Brice Maron (eMerzh) said [on twitter](https://twitter.com/eMerzh/status/1505969471718141958) he's interested to cover Brain l'Alleud and surroundings
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 21:57:35 - Thibaultmol: Have recently finally used my gopro hero 9 for a mapillary capture (haven't had time since I bought it to actually it).
Interesting how even though I myself made a forum post about how the hero 9 puts gps  data in it's exif data:
https://forum.mapillary.com/t/gopro-hero-9-does-have-gps-in-timelapse-mode/4729

Now that i've actually made footage last week, it wasn't there. So had to match it with a gpx track I recorded with osmand (which seemed to be off by 2 seconds).

The guide on how to do everything is going to require a bit of work I guess XD
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 21:58:05 - Thibaultmol: Are you getting gps coordinates on your gopro's joost_schouppe ?
If so: how accurate are they. Cause I've heard people complain about that with the gopro's
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 21:59:17 - joost_schouppe: Yep, always had GPS data on the images. And never had serious complaints about the quality of the fix.
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 22:00:02 - joost_schouppe: All I ever had to do was switch on the gps at the start. 
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 22:03:50 - joost_schouppe: You say there the 7 doesn't have gps on time-lapse, but it doed
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 22:07:11 - Thibaultmol: I'll have to check the settings then I suppose.

Also, I found out (haven't checked, but just based on the documentation) that there is currently with V4 of the mapillary api, now way to get the actual images at full res. Only a 'high res thumbnail'...
Obv you can't download the original originals anymore (unblurred) because they don't store those. But they do store the blurred full res versions. 
Those you can't download though.

So I'm trying to set up a system soon for people to start uploading their original files to me. Otherwise if we ever need to switch away from mapillary, we'll have lower quality data when we export
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 22:07:39 - Thibaultmol: so I guess maybe tell the current camera users that they should try and hold on to their original footage for now if they have enough storage space
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 22:09:27 - joost_schouppe: OK. If confirmed, might be an argument to upload to Kartaview first, and transfer to Mapillary from there
Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 22:13:24 - Thibaultmol: Someone should confirm it. 
Docs do mention 'thumb_original_url' but I just found that a weird way of naming it. Not sure
https://www.mapillary.com/developer/api-documentation/#image

Mon, Mar 21, 2022, 23:23:50 - timcouwelier: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "You say there the 7 doesn't have..."> Yes same - I get gps on the 7
Tue, Mar 22, 2022, 08:44:11 - Thibaultmol: Ok, got confirmation that it is indeed the full resolution image https://forum.mapillary.com/t/download-mapilarry-images-with-api-v4/5215/24?u=thibaultmol
Technically still better if we can backup the actual originals (in case of a bad blurring, or just in general keeping jpg compression quality) but yeah
Tue, Mar 22, 2022, 08:45:30 - joost_schouppe: OK, that's good news. But yes, the case remains for keeping the originals.
Wed, Mar 23, 2022, 15:03:26 - joost_schouppe: I made a first version of the Open StreetLevel Imagery project for OSM.be. Comments welcome! https://github.com/osmbe/website/blob/master/_drafts/project-streetlevelimagery.md

Thu, Mar 24, 2022, 06:42:23 - joost_schouppe: Cyclist with a 360 it seems. No, haven't seen this before! 
Sat, Mar 26, 2022, 13:54:07 - joost_schouppe: I do one little trip to Spain, and now I'm number 9 all time contributor on Mapillary in the country
Sat, Mar 26, 2022, 13:56:20 - joost_schouppe: (mmm and no 7 in France, though that's many trips)
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 12:04:17 - Thibaultmol: (not that it really matters that much, but joost_schouppe just so you know: the footage you've been uploading wasn't assigned to the osmbe mapillary org )
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 12:05:14 - joost_schouppe: Dammit
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 12:05:24 - joost_schouppe: Which footage though? 
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 13:21:18 - Thibaultmol: Well, nothing you've uploaded this year, has been linked to the org XD
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 13:21:47 - Thibaultmol: Guess you could contact support, but I think they're not able to move it
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 13:26:38 - joost_schouppe: What, that shouldn't be
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 13:27:04 - joost_schouppe: Would be nice if they gave error messages 
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 14:30:05 - joost_schouppe: https://www.mapillary.com/app/org/osmbelgium?lat=40.076573859660755&lng=1.6439932199159557&z=6.143156599938926
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 14:30:15 - joost_schouppe: I don't see the issue actually
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 14:32:59 - joost_schouppe: I'm guessing you're looking in mosmbelgium, not osmbelgium
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 14:56:00 - joost_schouppe: FIrst upload after a drive. All went well, [results are fine I think](https://www.mapillary.com/app/org/osmbelgium?lat=50.787950899972&lng=3.8734348999722&z=10.659726827558266&panos=true&pKey=352454010164207&x=0.9479793913455398&y=0.6173963135171121&zoom=0&focus=photo). Still processing. I did hit a small fly towards the end, but the impact on the image is relatively minor 
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 14:57:02 - joost_schouppe: Funnily enough, now the Lierde shots by Dirk are kind of connected to the Halle/Pepingen shot by a string. I did remove the camera on the motorway because I was a little worried
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 15:49:11 - Thibaultmol: oh derp yeah, sorry XD
(appears I'm not part of that org yet, forgot it existed)
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 15:49:41 - Thibaultmol: also sidenote: (assuming this is an id for the survey and not me specifically) mapillary is doing a survey: https://www.facebook.com/survey/?oid=332522592184448
Mon, Mar 28, 2022, 15:49:46 - joost_schouppe: nope, that's only for the camera's that were donated/bought by osmbe
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 13:26:08 - Thibaultmol: Anyone used the mapillary android/ios apps yet? (linking them with the camera). Any real advantages?
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 13:29:25 - joost_schouppe: Linked to an external camera you mean? Is that possible with a GoPro? I do use GoPro Quik to remotely operate the camera
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 13:31:52 - Thibaultmol: yeah, gopro's are the main camera's the app works with. I never looked into it because I figured
- it might not be saving to the sd card then
- would use more battery because it has to communicate with the phone
- feel like the chance of the mapillary app crashing or going into battery save because of aggressive phone battery management 
would just cause more problems. But i dunno
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 13:33:24 - Thibaultmol: (gopro linking isn't available on android still. Hence why i also never bothered I suppose)
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 16:36:14 - timcouwelier: it saves on the sd card
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 16:36:26 - timcouwelier: (ive done it with a hero 7 and and iphone)
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 16:36:47 - timcouwelier: but when I do it in car, both phone and gopro are hooked to a powerbank
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 16:37:11 - timcouwelier: (i removed the cap that covers the usb-c charging port so I can plug in cable while its in its holder)
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 16:38:40 - timcouwelier: mostly did as such so I had the map view or where there's imagery and where not
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 16:40:03 - joost_schouppe: <@timcouwelier:matrix.org "mostly did as such so I had the ..."> I use Osmand for that
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 16:42:57 - timcouwelier: osmand on iOS doesn't reach the ankles of the android version though.
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 16:43:49 - joost_schouppe: it doesn't!
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 19:18:33 - Thibaultmol: <@timcouwelier:matrix.org "(i removed the cap that covers t..."> So did you buy/print one of these covers to replace it then? Cause if you just take the cover off, the battery is just loose
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 19:19:07 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)
Tue, Mar 29, 2022, 19:19:10 - Thibaultmol: like these ones
Wed, Mar 30, 2022, 08:03:27 - timcouwelier: No battery is a different cover 
Wed, Mar 30, 2022, 09:07:11 - Thibaultmol: Oh, so how are you charging them while you're using it, without the battery disconnecting?
Wed, Mar 30, 2022, 09:08:47 - joost_schouppe: apparently, on his GoPro, you don't need to open the cover of the battery to be able to connect a charging cable.
Wed, Mar 30, 2022, 09:09:16 - joost_schouppe: Jo was also permanently charging on his bicycle with the GoPro Hero 7, and I don't think it ever gave battery issues
Wed, Mar 30, 2022, 09:12:33 - Thibaultmol: Oh i see, the hero 7 is before they changed it. hero 9 like mine has the downsideof having to open the battery door to be able to charge. So hence why you would need a 3rd party charging door if you want the battery to stay put
Wed, Mar 30, 2022, 09:12:37 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)
Wed, Mar 30, 2022, 09:25:27 - joost_schouppe: I've e-mailed Alexandru from Grab/KartaView to ask about their interest to work together on getting images on their platform as well
Wed, Mar 30, 2022, 11:48:45 - timcouwelier: yea on the 7 its different indeed.
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 17:52:44 - Seppe: Today, I have tried [this one](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/mounts-accessories/vented-helmet-strap-mount/GVHS30.html) during a very short ride. I used it with the OSM.be GoPro Max and a RAM thingy to get a bit of height. In short: not an ideal solution, because the RAM thingy and the Max have quite a bit of weight, pulling the straps every time you move your head just a little bit. I'll upload the images later.
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 18:52:55 - Seppe: GPS positioning on the GoPro Max seems top notch so far, better than my smartphone
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 18:58:24 - joost_schouppe: Their GPS has never disappointed me. Only issue I ever had is that the first pictures after taking a long tunnel are sometimes quite wrong 
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 19:47:23 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Their GPS has never disappointed..."> I have this issue with both GoPro 7 and Garmin VIRB ...
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 19:49:57 - joost_schouppe: Yeah, it's just normal. It takes a while before you get a good fix after you had no signal at all. But there's accuracy data of the GPS, and I'd expect Mapillary to use that to throw the bad ones out. Maybe they allowed worse signal not to have to throw away too many images
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 21:47:28 - Thibaultmol: Oh right, I forget Trekview (the guy I mentioned during the meeting) actually made a whole kit / guide
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 21:47:28 - Thibaultmol: https://guides.trekview.org/trek-pack/v2
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 21:51:16 - Thibaultmol: They seem to prefer video mode instead of timelapse. because their 'explorer' software is used for making 3d env I guess
https://guides.trekview.org/trek-pack/v2/camera-modes
So the more frames they have the better.
But for our use case that's not super releveant of course
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 22:50:17 - Seppe: Pretty happy with my first 360¬∞ sequence: https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=50.759825199999995&lng=2.895517199999972&z=18.336078076486757&pKey=515936460027353&focus=photo&x=0.9441437550273049&y=0.5154319458709816&zoom=0
Fri, Apr 1, 2022, 23:02:58 - Thibaultmol: (while I haven't really looked at much of the 360 footage) does it often happen actually that front and back have such different exposures?

Sat, Apr 2, 2022, 12:16:39 - joost_schouppe: Thx
Sat, Apr 2, 2022, 12:17:25 - joost_schouppe: No, just if you synchronise the device once with the gopro quik app. I think! 
Sat, Apr 2, 2022, 19:18:51 - Thibaultmol: didn't it sync via satlite?
Sat, Apr 2, 2022, 19:19:39 - Thibaultmol: (oh, only hero 9 and 10 are synced via satelite)
Sat, Apr 2, 2022, 19:22:33 - Thibaultmol: I guess he didn't adjust it indeed. Cause the dates are 2016 (which is the year the camera got released XD)
Sat, Apr 2, 2022, 19:55:44 - joost_schouppe: It's quite common to have that issue 
Sat, Apr 2, 2022, 19:56:31 - joost_schouppe: I raised this on the mapillary forum, because most of the other dates on the exif of the image are in fact correct. It would make sense to use GPS time by default 
Sat, Apr 2, 2022, 21:34:03 - Thibaultmol: yeah, and if people are uploading with the normal desktop application. I think there it should ATLEAST give a popup up like 'hey... these images were captured like 6 years ago... are you sure about that?" XD

Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:21:40 - Thibaultmol invited St√©phane De Greef
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:22:01 - St√©phane De Greef joined the room
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:22:42 - St√©phane De Greef: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Hehe, and he found it necessary ..."> I got worried for a second you were talking about me ;)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:24:35 - Thibaultmol: Was discussing with St√©phane in DM's about how we could get his footage on the server (seeing as there is no camera/sdcard exchange. And double uploading (to mapillary and then to my server) is hard to justify because of our lovely internet monopolies.

So I was wondering: could OSMBE buy some harddrive enclosures (they're pretty damn cheap) and then I just put my spare 3TB drives in there. And when they fill up, OSMBE makes a shipping label so they're sent to me and we send an empty one back.
Just an idea, curious to hear your thoughts
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:25:13 - joost_schouppe: what volume we talking about?
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:25:24 - joost_schouppe: Note that I also have Thierry's personal archive of about 1 terra
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:25:39 - joost_schouppe: If you have the space, I'd also like to move it
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:26:37 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:26:45 - joost_schouppe: I liked the idea of having a few 400 gig SD cards, as it makes for easier, safer and cheaper data sending
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:28:01 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "I liked the idea of having a few..."> I thought we already discussed this option and agreed on it?!
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:29:23 - Thibaultmol: Fair, I am 100% on ssd's on all my systems except my nas systems obv.
But because I was budget oriented for this, I figured reusing the hdd's might be best.
But if we go ssd. it would give us the advantage of
- only needing a small sata to usb cable, (assuming we're using regular ssd's and not regular exeternal ssd's)
- shipping box will be smaller, might even be able to use one of those padded envelopes, which bpost can also ship cheaper I think
- indeed be more secure (shaking is no problem)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:30:19 - Thibaultmol: SD cards right, yeah. We did agree on that yeah. But was starting to doubt in this specific use case (where someone is constantly making data) that it might not be the best option
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:30:48 - Thibaultmol: But I guess SD cards could be fine, we can just put them in the regular post as the original plan for camera-lenders
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 18:39:56 - Thibaultmol: , St√©phane De Greef do you have an sd card reader / slot?
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:17:15 - St√©phane De Greef: Yup - SD card and Micro-SD adapter.
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:35:03 - Thibaultmol: joost_schouppe you'll look into buying the sd card(s) then?
(tweakers prices haven't changed. technically the samsung 512gb was better price/gb but yeah, you can go with the same one as last time as well  if you want  https://tweakers.net/geheugenkaarten/vergelijken/#filter:TY7BCoMwEET_Zc-hJKma1g8QPPTksXhIk5UGopFEpCD-eze2lF52mZnHMBs8op5saxPUd8F5xehcegZuWjEu3TPMHXo0iwsT1IP2CRmEaDE2Dr2FGtKMxg3O6AP5hl2IC2U6mZ9DWEu8khWDOTqDN0eNnB0FjfMLRtqwgSir_MacguT8xKli1K-PynJnBKkMrdrTbDiX6go92VKo4s8vBPkMVMElxfv-Bg )
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:36:55 - Thibaultmol: So we'll just do a thing then where once the sd card is full, you can send it to me St√©phane De Greef 
(just make sure the sd card is withing something so it can't slide out of the envelope in case it gets damaged. Something made of plastic that can't get ripped easily. LIke an L-mapje folded to fit inside the envelope)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:37:54 - joost_schouppe: I already bought one, Seppe has it now. I could order two to be delivered to Stephane
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:38:18 - St√©phane De Greef: Sd cards are usually sold in solid plastic sleeves. Will what do?
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:38:35 - joost_schouppe: I did buy a more expensive one: https://www.bol.com/be/nl/p/sandisk-extreme-microsdxc-400gb-u3-v30-a2-160mb-s-met-adapter/9200000096275122/?s2a=
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:39:33 - St√©phane De Greef: Which reminds me, I have to investigate why sometimes my GoPro skips recording one in every five pics. Could be defective battery, as it occurred just after battery swap.
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:40:38 - joost_schouppe: that's a weird issue
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:43:13 - St√©phane De Greef sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:43:35 - St√©phane De Greef: Yet clearly visible. It takes 3 or 4 pics then skips a single one.
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:43:38 - joost_schouppe: did you restart the camera later as well?
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:43:55 - St√©phane De Greef: I have to do some tests and try to reproduce the issue. 
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:47:31 - St√©phane De Greef sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:49:18 - St√©phane De Greef: Definitely a weird thing. Not GPS strength issue as zero obstacle, not a SD card issue as the same card is used. I can only think of a battery issue that is not giving enough power to the camera to keep with data writing rate.
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:50:34 - St√©phane De Greef: I'll try to write to GoPro and ask if they can fix/replace as the LCD and power button also work funny. You never know.
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:51:48 - joost_schouppe: maybe those are three related issues. Faulty electronics somewhere
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:52:15 - joost_schouppe: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "I did buy a more expensive one: ..."> thibaultmol: are cheaper ones good enough for the Max?
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:52:27 - joost_schouppe: St√©phane De Greef: how much data do you have for Thibault?
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:53:40 - Thibaultmol: I should mention: as st√©phane is constantly going to be generating data and doesn't have enough to store it. It might be best if he kept into an sd card an filled it over time.
Instead of doing it in batches
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:53:47 - St√©phane De Greef: I've systematically deleted all my original pictures until yesterday. I don't have lots of storage lying around as I'm doing photo/video editing.
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 19:56:14 - joost_schouppe: ah OK. I could send you two anyway, and IF we need it for something else before you fill up the second one, you just post it to the next one?
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:01:43 - St√©phane De Greef: Sure. ;) I'm using up 30gb a week or so.
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:11:24 - Thibaultmol: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "thibaultmol: are cheaper ones go..."> Probably. But i think it's best that St√©phane just keeps 'our backup sd card' and his card seperate maybe? 

Cause I can imagine it might get hard to keep track of what's been uploaded and what's not yet been uploaded otherwise
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:11:36 - Thibaultmol: But it's up to St√©phane I suppose on how he wants to do it
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:12:07 - Thibaultmol: also: (from what I understand of the sd card specification. those samsung cards are U3 which is higher than the recommend level 10.. so should be fine)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:12:17 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)

Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:16:56 - Thibaultmol: Think so yeah
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:17:21 - joost_schouppe: And yeah, you don' necessarily want to keep these as your SINGLE copy of the picture. I don't trust them not to crash. I'd use them as a backup only. But you can use them for your daily shoot, copy somewhere safe; and fill them all up when you're ready to snailmail the data
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:31:07 - Thibaultmol: I think that was St√©phane's problem though. he doesn't have enough space to temp store them.
So I would assume he just uses his card like usual and copies the data after every trip to the backup sd card
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:31:47 - St√©phane De Greef: Yup - i'd probably upload a copy straight on mapillary and keep you a copy of the originals on the SD card.
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:32:07 - St√©phane De Greef: but I'll need to clear up my microSD
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:33:21 - joost_schouppe: well you'll have two extra cards to play with :)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:34:01 - joost_schouppe: I'd just recommend copy-pasting, not cutting-and-pasting. And keeping more than one copy around at least until upload, preferably untilm backupped
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:38:50 - Thibaultmol: St√©phane De Greefyou could upload to mapillary straight from the sd card (which is what I assume you do atm) and while that's happening, copy to the other sd card if you have a second reader or a reader that can do both regular sd and microsd at the same time. put the other one in an adapter to full sd.
(note: many sd card reader can't do both cards at the same time)
Mon, Apr 4, 2022, 20:51:40 - joost_schouppe: Cards are on the way 
Tue, Apr 5, 2022, 08:31:19 - St√©phane De Greef: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Cards are on the way "> Nice, will let you know when they arrive
Thu, Apr 7, 2022, 16:17:32 - Thibaultmol: (just gonna mention real quick: Mapillary support can indeed move imagery sequences from an individual user to an org. In case it was uploaded incorrectly. Good to know https://forum.mapillary.com/t/adding-organisation-to-existing-360-images-solved/5948/2 )
Thu, Apr 7, 2022, 16:28:02 - joost_schouppe: hhmm, I'll ask for a move for some pictures where I made a mistake!
Sat, Apr 9, 2022, 11:11:04 - Thibaultmol: Seppe you still got the 360 cam? 
Do you need it on Sunday (tomorrow)? Cause I'm hoping to the japanse garden in Hasselt and might use it there a bit. (Have yet to receive answer on if the person that's joining is ok with being in shot even if his face will be blurred)
Sat, Apr 9, 2022, 11:48:31 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: yes out of curiosity ... as the Japanese garden is a "private domain", are you going to ask permission to the operator or not?
Sat, Apr 9, 2022, 11:50:49 - Thibaultmol: Oh yeah that's a fair point actually... I mean I am friends with the owner

Sat, Apr 9, 2022, 12:51:40 - Thibaultmol: No worries üëç. It's a small area anyway
Mon, Apr 11, 2022, 16:19:05 - Seppe: St√©phane De Greef: Am I seeing it right you're also using this GoPro "Vented Helmet Strap Mount"? Are you using something to give the camera a little bit of height? Or do you mount the camera directly onto the "strap mount"?
Mon, Apr 11, 2022, 16:56:17 - St√©phane De Greef: I have several systems - I used a PVC tube in a backpack earlier but it was really hard to control a straight horizon. So I moved to the vented helmet strap mount, which works fine. I re-elevated it a bit with two old GoPro mount extensions, so the camera is about 10cm above the helmet. I used a small block of foam as well to stabilise the camera as the strap mount is flatish and my helmet is roundish so there was a bit of lateral swinging.
Mon, Apr 11, 2022, 16:56:29 - St√©phane De Greef: I'll get you a shot 
Mon, Apr 11, 2022, 16:57:31 - St√©phane De Greef: the higher the cam, the less helmet you see on the pic, but the stronger the lever from inertia - so the straps need to be tightened ever 10-20 min.

Mon, Apr 11, 2022, 17:23:21 - St√©phane De Greef: Most gimbals are attached laterally, not under. And it wouldn't do much good for GPM as it's already stabilised in 360 vid√©o mode. So yeah, very niche market.

Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 15:24:46 - Seppe: I apparently have a sequence with the GoPro max that is 'backwards' (not the camera itself, but the setting on the camera). In 360, this doesn't really matter I guess, but I was wondering if Mapillary would feel the same about that. Here is an example:

Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 15:36:31 - Seppe: BTW, the two hours of battery life for the Max is probably when it's a bit colder. Today, I got about an hour more out of it I think.
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 16:26:41 - Thibaultmol: Yeah, wouldn't have expected it to be that much a difference though, oof.
I do remember people complaining about the previous gen cam (fusion) simply overheating on sunny days
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 17:30:31 - St√©phane De Greef: <@Seppe:matrix.org "I apparently have a sequence wit..."> There's a setting on the touchscreen to select if the main lens is the front or back one.

Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 17:30:52 - St√©phane De Greef: (whenever I selected the back one as the main one )
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 18:15:25 - Seppe: Yes, I knew about the setting and used it to make sure the horizon is in the middle of the frame on both sides, but I didn't think about setting it to the front camera when I started the recording.
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 18:16:12 - Seppe: Thanks for the tip to change the orientation. I've already uploaded a first sequence to see the result, but I have a second one with the same 'problem'
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 18:26:19 - joost_schouppe: Could you add a little description about this in the instructions document? 
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 18:32:29 - Seppe: Will do after I've tried St√©phanes solution
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 21:00:52 - Thibaultmol: First time actually using the gopro with it's built in gps to upload to mapillary. Have you guys had this before?.

Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 21:16:46 - Thibaultmol: yeah, should be fine just to contact them.

Do you guys have issues with the first section of a capture round being... off? Like the gps coordinates of most of my sequences are fine, but the first part of the sequence is like.. quite off from the actual road (in my opinion)

Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 21:17:24 - Thibaultmol: I figured it might be that it didn't have a lock on the gps sats yet, but it only includes exif gps data once it does have a good lock iirc
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 21:18:32 - Seppe: I usually delete the first few images because they are often taken during setup, getting my head/bike horizontal etc.
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 21:19:08 - Thibaultmol: oh yeah no, first couple I forgot to delete in this case. but it's ones after, still feels like they're quite off
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 21:19:23 - Thibaultmol: the highlighted ones in the Kasteelstraat there
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 21:25:30 - Seppe: Ah yes, I see. When syncing images to a gpx track recorded on my smartphone, the images were sometimes very off, with the GoPro Max we're testing the last two weeks it seems to be spot on
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 21:26:33 - Thibaultmol: gpx tended to more accurate for me actually. but the gopro's built in gps is better cause of convenience reasons.
So having to interpolate the direction for gopro images is normal right (cause it doesn't have compas?)
Fri, Apr 15, 2022, 22:35:26 - St√©phane De Greef: I usually turn on the GoPro a minute before recording to ensure I have a proper fix on satellites before recording. I also make use of the voice control to start and stop the camera without messing with the orientation. You'll learn to speak with a robot voice to say "GOPRO, TIMELAPSE MODE." "GOPRO, START TIMELAPSE." "GOPRO, STOP CAPTURE" !

That first section might be off because it's a bit of a street canyon? Might get better results if you have it grab its location in a bit more "open" location first 
Sat, Apr 16, 2022, 08:52:45 - Thibaultmol: hmmm, that is a good point. Although I feel like that shouldn't happen with regular 2 story + roof, row buildings. i'm in bumfuck nowhere, not ghent XD
But yeah, guess it might have still affected it. Which you could adjust the location slightly (not individual images.. but like... the vector that the image are on , you know)
Sat, Apr 16, 2022, 09:02:51 - joost_schouppe: I think it definitely wouldn't happen there if you start with a good fix. But maybe initial error is persistent in this kind of area.
Sat, Apr 16, 2022, 10:03:29 - St√©phane De Greef: I wish there was an option in Mapillary to drag and drop images which location is obviously off.

Sat, Apr 16, 2022, 10:36:05 - joost_schouppe: it'll come back one day I guess. But posting about it in the forum can give it a little push
Sat, Apr 16, 2022, 18:15:44 - Seppe: <@stefdegreef:matrix.org "There's a setting on the touchsc..."> I'm afraid changing the orientation at upload doesn't do the trick. If you open [this image](https://www.mapillary.com/app/?pKey=699564717901199), it opens showing what was behind me, but the map icon is pointing at what was in front of me. To make it worse, if I turn to what was left of me, the map icon is pointing at what was right of me.
Sat, Apr 16, 2022, 18:19:14 - Seppe: I think I had better left it as it was. In that case, the image would still open showing what was behind me, but the viewing angle on the map would be correct, like in this example of the first sequence I've uploaded "backwards" (and to which I didn't apply any correction): https://www.mapillary.com/app/?pKey=1157952581684987
Thu, Apr 21, 2022, 20:57:06 - joost_schouppe: Answer from Kartaview:
> We're always supportive of adding more imagery to KartaView! Our strong focus as a team working for Grab is Southeast Asia but KartaView chugs along and continues being a useful platform for the OSM community. The smoothest path that comes to mind in ingesting images if the team is still storing the files is by using the upload scripts (https://github.com/kartaview/upload-scripts). This step avoids the file download from Mapillary (when using photosync) and is pretty straight forward to operate with some knowledge of terminal.
Fri, Apr 22, 2022, 08:04:10 - Thibaultmol: Nice to hear! I'll look into that then, but first I'll try and have the uploading working to my server in a convenient matter. Should be done next week. (Been busier in and around the pharmacy than expected).

I was wondering: at Open Belgium, there's an osm booth, right? Is that constantly manned?

Sun, Apr 24, 2022, 11:38:56 - Thibaultmol: Have had to do a ton of garden work this week and listed to some osmUS SOTM presentations. One of which was about using machine learning to determine missing roads in indonesia using satelite and gps points.
Interesting thing: It was presented by Grab AND Meta. So they're working together, atleast for their GrabMaps in Indonesia. Interesting tidbit I learned
Mon, Apr 25, 2022, 20:42:29 - @thierry1030:matrix.org: I took today the whole day pictures (7500 in total) during a cycling trip between Liege, Verviers and Pepinster. The devastating effects of the floods are still very visible. In my enthuasiasm (it was really nice weather as well) I forgot to change/actualise the date of the GoPro ü•¥, so all my pictures have now 2-1-2016 as a timestamp. Is there an easy and quick way to change the date of the timestamp?

Fri, May 6, 2022, 14:39:57 - Thibaultmol: I don't think it is. It's just the same like with any other camera where you'd have to extract from a video. I guess the only problem might be that tesla don't same gps data alongside it. But i'm not sure if those dashcams do either though

I'm doubtful Mapillary will care. But Figured It'd suggest it anyway.
When talking to Robin from Onwheels, he wondered if Mapillary could detect blind/visually-impaired infrastructure like tactile pavements panels

Sat, May 14, 2022, 11:23:24 - Thibaultmol: hi eMerzh yeah that's me
So far I haven't actually setup a method to easily upload to my server. It's just been copying from sd cards to my drive whenever there's a meetup.

I'll look into it next week maybe to get that setup

Yeah guess it can all be generated after later again.... Hmm, guess it's fine maybe. It'd be different if people were using camera's that don't put the gps data in the photos and such. But with the gopro's this is no issue
Sun, May 15, 2022, 23:28:13 - Thibaultmol: Does the desktop uploader not to duplicate detection (like mapillary_tools cli does)?
Because If I give it 17 images of me waiting at a stop light, it seems like it's not detecting them as duplicates and will happily upload them... even though it probably shouldn't bother
Mon, May 16, 2022, 06:57:48 - timcouwelier: afaik it only checks if mapillary server doesn't have the EXACT image 
Mon, May 16, 2022, 06:57:56 - timcouwelier: (assuming based on stuff like timestamps)
Mon, May 16, 2022, 06:58:07 - timcouwelier: so its more to avoid duplication of entire sequences
Mon, May 16, 2022, 06:58:17 - timcouwelier: then filtering out multiples from time interval imagery
Mon, May 16, 2022, 06:58:30 - timcouwelier: (as those aren't *exactly* the same)
Mon, May 16, 2022, 07:22:26 - joost_schouppe: Correct. The command line interface can remove duplicates (eg at traffic lights), but I've read it has some side effects (like deleting good pictures in slow curves). So I've kept on manually removing duplicates

Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:38:39 - Thibaultmol: What are people's methods of deleting dupes then? (like do you go trough all the images and delete them when you a bunch of similar ones?)
Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:39:24 - joost_schouppe: I actually do that, yes
Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:40:10 - Thibaultmol: Curious how well a 'similar image' tool would be at detecting those. will report back
Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:40:36 - joost_schouppe: I think it would actually be easier in a GIS tool
Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:40:44 - Thibaultmol: oh yeah that's true actually
Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:54:11 - Thibaultmol: hmmm... if you set similarity level to 0, then I already got some out of there. But not that many still. when I go to similarity level 1, it starts showing me images that shouldn't be deleted. So guess not super effective. Would be interesting if someone combined an image dupe algorithm with the gps coordinates though
(for context, am using Czkawka, bad name, great tool. Open source file dupe program)
Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:55:31 - Seppe: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "I actually do that, yes"> +1
Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:55:48 - Thibaultmol: St√©phane De Greef thierry.js1030 do you guys also go trough the images manually to remove duplicates? (waiting at traffic lights and such) 
Mon, May 16, 2022, 09:59:03 - Thibaultmol: Also, on the non-360 cams. 0.5 seconds or 1 sec?
Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:01:17 - joost_schouppe: 2sec

Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:01:36 - joost_schouppe: I usually do 0.5
Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:05:43 - Thibaultmol: I guess wit the Geotagged images plugin in josm you can do a review relativley quickly
Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:08:10 - St√©phane De Greef: I do every 2sec on the 360 cam, and only delete the pics which aren't straight or showing my face when I forgot to turn it off before removing the helmet. Every picture counts ü§£
Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:10:02 - St√©phane De Greef: Some can be sharper, some can have cars or people hiding features. I prefer to keep it all and reviewing thousands of pics to delete a few dozens isn't a good use of my time.
Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:10:56 - St√©phane De Greef: So yeah, only deleting when quality is too poor to use.
Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:25:51 - Thibaultmol: Fair enough, mapillary tooling should be better, cause many of these things could be semi-automated stil. but yeah.
Also: if you notice the gps coordinates are off. What do you guys do?
- keep it
- modify the gps coordinates on the images (if so: using what tool)
- delete them
Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:26:18 - Thibaultmol: Like here, it did a weird offset for that street somehow

Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:30:46 - St√©phane De Greef: I keep it all. It's easy for people who do manual mapping to understand it's that street and find features. It's usually because building block GPS signal or because the camera didn't understand your position following sudden change of direction.
Mon, May 16, 2022, 10:31:06 - Thibaultmol: (I don't have much time to do actual image capturing atm. And most of my bike riding time is spent doing deliveres for the pharmacy, which i obv can't capture then. Cause the gps traces of the images could show where our patients live.

Maybe we can work together to save a little money on buying the gear. I was also thinking it might be useful to work together on finding volunteers as well; e.g. like I did just now with Vincent B. We could make an e-mail address like open360@osm.be where we can both recieve mails (and hopefully some more people who want to help). And we could give space to your project on the osm.be project page. Or you can just do your own, thing, that's also fine :)

Tue, May 17, 2022, 11:19:16 - joost_schouppe: maybe try the forum as well, now that you've found the source of the issue. Maybe there's a way to force Mapillary to order by filename instead of timestamp. Or I guess you could do some automatic processing to "fix" outlier timestamps
Tue, May 17, 2022, 11:24:57 - Thibaultmol: I was indeed one firmware update behind, changelog doesn't mention anything about it. But who knows. I guess I'll manually fix it for now and see if it happens on future sequences
Tue, May 17, 2022, 11:25:22 - Thibaultmol: Btw, are our gopro max's in the field also being firmware updates every now and then?
Tue, May 17, 2022, 11:36:50 - joost_schouppe: I haven't really checked recently. The latest one came fully up to dat fwiw
Tue, May 17, 2022, 13:56:08 - Seppe: Colleague Glenn asks about the TimeWarp mode on the GoPro Max. I've looked into the explanation by GoPro, but I don't really understand what it is. Glenn wonders whether this would be a better method for shouting streetview imagery
Tue, May 17, 2022, 13:56:41 - Seppe: I guess it produces video and that is enough to not use it for streetview purposes, right?
Tue, May 17, 2022, 13:57:56 - Seppe: However, it would be cool if the stabilizing features could be applied to individual images as well
Tue, May 17, 2022, 13:58:15 - Seppe: Or am I then asking to change the rules of physics? :-)
Tue, May 17, 2022, 13:58:41 - Thibaultmol: it just comlicates things . Cause timelapse photo mode already puts gps in the images. With the video you'd have to count on your phone or another device recording gpx data and then having to merge that with the data using the mapillary CLI
Tue, May 17, 2022, 13:59:07 - Thibaultmol: plus I think the timewarp feature specifically had some problems if you extract single frames from it (that it was quite blurry or something iirc)
Tue, May 17, 2022, 14:00:03 - Seppe: Makes sense, thanks!
Tue, May 17, 2022, 14:00:37 - Thibaultmol: hmmm, looking on the forums, someone is using that mode though it seems

Tue, May 17, 2022, 14:01:49 - Thibaultmol: Seems like it might reduce battery life a lot though, it's taking 10 frames per second, which is more much more than we need. But if that halfs the battery life, not sure how worth it that is. (plus the added complexity) 
Tue, May 17, 2022, 14:03:01 - Thibaultmol: Plus in general you'll have lower quality because it's extracted from a video. And honestly i'm pretty impressed by the stabilization during timelapse photo mode.
Tue, May 17, 2022, 15:13:52 - joost_schouppe: We should all badger GoPro to just improve the way the timelapse mode works
Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:01:03 - Thibaultmol: Seppe about your question. I also asked it to Dave (from Trekview, the company that has done a lot of guides on streetview imagery using consumer camera's and claims to working on his/their own platform. But more meant for leasure photography than actual streetview I believe)
Their main documentation for example: https://guides.trekview.org/trek-pack/v2

Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:01:13 - Thibaultmol: our convo:
Dave:

> For walking I still use photos for all the reasons you describe. I recently went skiing and used video at 24fps, simply because you can cover a lot of ground in 2s (lowest interval setting on the MAX).
> 
> But, I am now swimming in video files that are much more difficult to work with.
> 
> I guess the ultimate question is, what do you want to achieve with the images? In many case 10 meters between photos (18km/h) might be acceptable and avoid the additional overhead of working with video.
> If GoPro offered a 1 second interval on the MAX in 360 mode, I'd choose that every time.
Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:02:47 - Thibaultmol: Me:

> So I guess if the 2 second interval is 'fine' for us, then best to continue using photo mode?

Dave:

> I'd agree with that. Just ask the cyclists to keep to a leisurely pace, no racing üôÇ

Me:

> We don't **need** 1 sec interval, but we'd gladly take it if possible without suffering quality loss (which video mode would cause from my understanding)

Dave:

> yep. although the MAX says video at 5.6k (which is slightly lower res than image mode), this is actually upscaled in GoPro Studio. The true resolution of MAX videos is actually 4k in reality.
Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:11:58 - Thibaultmol: And I asked him about Timewarp is particular, if it'd be useful for our usecase:

> Not really. the fastest timewarp mode is 2x
> 
> also, it gets fiddly to adjust the frame time to GPS time (https://www.trekview.org/blog/2022/turn-gopro-timewarp-video-into-timelapse-images/)

 

Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:12:55 - joost_schouppe: the gist of all this, to me, is that the device can produce better results, but its software doesn't support it. And you can work around the limitations, but then you have much more, you know, work :)
Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:16:39 - Thibaultmol: I'm not sure actually
Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:17:06 - Thibaultmol: I think because the total filesize of a jpg is higher than a diff frame of a video file. It might not have the processing power to actually process and save jpg's at twice the rate
Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:22:16 - joost_schouppe: oh ok
Tue, May 17, 2022, 17:22:39 - joost_schouppe: well then I guess I prefer quality over quantity in this case
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:03:53 - eMerzh: do you guys have method to cover all streets with imagery? atm the coverage is low, so i'm good, but i can see that i'm already passing a few times a the same place....
i was thinking about mappilary trails but they seems to be slow to update ü§î
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:18:39 - joost_schouppe: Yes, they can be a little slow. Seems to depend on the day as well. If you're in a hurry, you could keep gpx tracks of your trips and keep those activated in your app
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:19:56 - joost_schouppe: It helps to have a structured approach, e.g. planning a trip in advance to a certain neighborhood. Then the next trip could be the other part of town. By the time you need to continue at the other end, it should be visible on mapillary 
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:23:41 - timcouwelier: and for 'verkaveling' (planned living neighbourhoods) it often just helps to err.. 'trace the outer edge' 
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:35:56 - Thibaultmol: TECHNICALLY you could extract the gps coordinates from your imagery (or record it seperatly on your phone) and put that on map. Then you don't need to wait for mapillary to update
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:36:27 - joost_schouppe: Or you know, just track your trip with OsmAnd :) 
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:38:17 - Thibaultmol: yeah that' what I meant with recording seperatly
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:38:30 - Thibaultmol: I guess if you do it in osmand, you have the advantage of it already overlaying on your map
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:38:35 - joost_schouppe: Ah yes :) 
Tue, May 17, 2022, 21:39:09 - joost_schouppe: Yep, as well as having mapillary available (and you can even filter 360 only)

Thu, May 19, 2022, 21:09:51 - Thibaultmol: Update regarding the mapillary files: if you don't do anything special (set special offsets / add gps data from gpx files / etc..), so like if you only process it normally and do direction interpolation. Then feel free to delete the mapillary files
Thu, May 19, 2022, 21:10:31 - Thibaultmol: Having that many extra files (even if small) won't be useful for storing them. we can always generate those later using mapillary_tools if needed.

if you do however do special things, ten it would be best to keep the mapillary files

You do need to interpolate the direction before you upload to mapillary. But other than that, works out of the box

Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:18:20 - Thibaultmol: OH, so it's not possible to set the time correctly on it? 

Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:19:01 - Thibaultmol: What you could do, is install the special Labs firmware on it. Then use a qr code generator to sync it's time everytime you start. 
But it's weird that Joost isn't having this issue
Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:19:25 - thierry.js1030: <@thibaultmol:matrix.org "OH, so it's not possible to set ..."> it's possible, but you have to 'register' every time (basically every day you want use it) MANUALLY üòë
Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:20:23 - thierry.js1030: and it happens that somebody forgets to set up the correct time BEFORE shooting new pictures
Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:21:23 - Thibaultmol: There are tools that you can adjust all images based on an offset. but you shouldn't have to do that obv.
Is the gopro on the latest firmware? maybe it just needs to be connected via the gopro app to get a network gps sync or something
Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:23:17 - Thibaultmol: -------
Sidenote: having the Labs firmware on one of the Max's would be interesting. With this feature: https://gopro.github.io/labs/control/speedtrigger/
You can have the gopro start and stop capture based on movement speed (also works on max and probably on timelapse photo mode, I would assume)

So you flash the special labs firmware on it. And then generate the qr code you want with the right settings and show it to the gopro, it'll scan it and do that.

Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:53:50 - joost_schouppe: I ONLY have this loss of correct datetime issue when you remove the battery AND then remove/insert the SD card (or perhaps accidentally hit the power button; or if you leave it without battery a long time) 
Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:54:12 - joost_schouppe: It is annoying, especially when you have some forgetful people on your team :)
Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:54:32 - joost_schouppe: It is indeed an easy fix afterwards, if you get the exiftool to work on your system
Mon, May 23, 2022, 12:56:55 - thierry.js1030: "I ONLY have this loss of correct datetime issue when you remove the battery AND then remove/insert the SD card" -> same with us!
Mon, May 23, 2022, 13:34:22 - Thibaultmol: HUH, interesting. Don't think the hero 9 has this issue. (cause i've def taken out the battery and sd card at the same time without this issue) But I'll pay attention to it.

Mon, May 23, 2022, 13:49:27 - joost_schouppe: I wouldn't be surprised the issue is caused by a little blinking light that flickers when you take out the chip. If they dropped that, maybe the issue is gone
Mon, May 23, 2022, 21:31:26 - joost_schouppe: As a little experiment, I created a "task" to map maxspeeds in Pepingen (one of the municipalities recently covered by 360). Finished three squares in an hour or so; it is pretty though, because Mapillary does not recognize all the traffic signs, the official data is very outdated, and there are some huge zone 50. Oh, and on the municipal boundary, the zone50 actually continues: one municplity thought "that means we have to put a start sign" and the other thought "everything's fine if we just remove the "end sign". You can try it out at http://tasks.osm.ch/projects/33/tasks . (If you want to use JOSM, it might be a hassle to get it to work; it seems impossible to change the default). http://tasks.osm.ch/projects/33/tasks
Mon, May 23, 2022, 21:32:07 - joost_schouppe: From this first experience, I think it makes sense to do maxspeeds independently. Then maybe do a next task to map: cycleway; sidewalk; surface; lit
Mon, May 23, 2022, 21:32:54 - joost_schouppe: I used the mapstyle "maxpseed" in JOSM; for other topics I'm sure there's other mapstyles to use
Mon, May 23, 2022, 21:36:03 - Thibaultmol: (oh neat, didn't know osm swis had their own task manager. nice)
Mon, May 23, 2022, 21:37:46 - joost_schouppe: Yep, and I believe the only one that advertises itself for global use by anyone on the community 
Tue, May 24, 2022, 09:17:12 - joost_schouppe: Now that I keep close track of uploads, I seme to have the impression that images that are uploaded with the command line tool, are much quicker to show up on the mapillary map
Tue, May 24, 2022, 10:23:22 - Thibaultmol: Interesting, cause mapillary desktop should also just be using the commandline version behind the scenes....
Tue, May 24, 2022, 10:42:01 - joost_schouppe: still there are some obvious differences between the results! E.g. the interpolation seems to yield different results

Fri, Jun 10, 2022, 22:29:30 - joost_schouppe: Maybe we should write these things out a bit, about how much image cleaning we expect. I wrote the following in reply to a mail from Vincent Bombaerts:
Fri, Jun 10, 2022, 22:29:33 - joost_schouppe: I think it's necessary to do a very quick viewing of your images to throw out the really bad ones at the start and end. I've also tried once to make clean sections to avoid having the same street twice. But it's a lot of work, it's easy to make mistakes. And you have to create a new folder every time you create a break. That way there are no connections between pictures that are not near each other. I do clean out duplicates at traffic lights. In theory, the Mapillary command line tool can do this automatically, but I don't really trust it.¬†


I try to avoid covering the same area too many times, though sometimes things do change quickly.


For the sensitive areas, Mapillary does ask to avoid taking images on private property. I believe it's their responsibility to remove images that break the law. Just like the government comes to OSM to ask to remove certain data, and not to the individual mapper.

(Tldr: a way to ocr dashcam footage to check for speed limit signs and compare that to osm.
It doesn't really apply to Flanders because of the traffic sign database that we have. But it's still interesting to see I guess.

The only thing that seems quite convoluted is that he didn't use overpass for some reason)
Wed, Jun 29, 2022, 08:46:12 - joost_schouppe: hehe, yeah, I thought "why such a long process to get osm data". But if you want a huge amount of data like that, it kind of makes sense
Wed, Jun 29, 2022, 08:47:24 - joost_schouppe: I actually would very much for us to try and detect Belgian traffic signs on all the Belgian pictures. We might be able to get a more detailed database; the traffic signs database in Flanders is still mostly outdated; and there is none in Wallonia

Seems to have forked a lot of the open source project from mapillary (icons atleast) 
Wed, Jul 13, 2022, 10:31:21 - Thibaultmol: Noticed someone asking in the Trekview discord about what the status was of the project and if him and his team could take it over
Wed, Jul 13, 2022, 11:04:13 - Thibaultmol: Message I got from the founder:

> We have just launched the platform and still on Beta. All the automation and other process like Mapillary provided is available on our side.
> 
> You can use any device such as Mobile Phones, Go-Pro and 360 Laydbug 5 + kind of surveying cars records. About licensing issues we still working on and would be ready within couple weeks.
> 
> Yes we have used some of the mapillary icons on dataset while preparing ours. But most of them are common so best to use whats already available.
> 
> Mapilio will be different than Mapillary on couple things at the beginning. Mapilio will be a platform to be accessible everyone. Any individuals and organisation will be easly to use and upload to our Platform. We automated extracting accurate map data. The main difference we do have is we are focusing mainly on generating accurate positioning and scaling the data. For now we can generate data under 0.5 meter geolocation accuracy and able to scale data by providing the area as well.
Wed, Jul 13, 2022, 11:15:08 - Thibaultmol: > We can help you to integrate on our platform and work together. Like mentioned we are on beta and some of our features are still in progress. But while we are launching it would be better to work with community. So any suggestion or improvements would be welcome.

I mentioned how what we're lacking with Mapillary is engagement with the local mapping communities. And for ex how Mapillary doesn't really care about Belgian specific traffic sign stuff
Wed, Jul 13, 2022, 11:31:33 - joost_schouppe: Once they clear up the license issue, this could be interesting 
Wed, Jul 13, 2022, 12:27:40 - Thibaultmol: > We havent planned to import from Mapillary to Mapilio but sounds beneficial. This could be done. We will look into it.

> Yes we are aware of the false detection. We have created a score system where lower scored data object will be verified by communities. Identifying the object for specific countries is not always easy. We currently have over 550 class but sometimes we also overwhelmed as it bit tricky for AI.

> Can you please give more details about analyzing footage for traffic signs. ?

> We are integrating with Openstreetmap Editor currently on alfa stage will launch soon.  Rest of other tools will be added to our Road Map.

> We can train more specific data if required. We have created a labeling platform which we offer free as well.
Wed, Jul 13, 2022, 12:29:45 - Thibaultmol: I guess what are like the top 5/10 traffic signs we would like to be able to detect?
Thu, Jul 14, 2022, 09:06:01 - joost_schouppe: I think the F99 series would be nice; and especially annoying is the missing exceptions for oneway for cyclist (and mofa, moped, speed pedelec)

Tue, Jul 26, 2022, 09:54:06 - St√©phane De Greef: So - just so you don't make this mistake - I've almost lost 58km of streetview work yesterday. As I was running out of space for backing up my images, I had decided to leave the previous day's 360 images on the microSD card and not reformat it, so I would have a copy on my hard drive and one on the card. That was a critical mistake. The Mapillary uploader uploaded log files and possibly modified some of the images on the SD card, messing up the file system. When I used the SD card and the camera yesterday, everything looked normal. The card was detected, the camera was recording timelapses as usual, and I rode my bike for 58 km across Woluwe - but when I got home, I realised the GoPro couldn't preview the images I took. When I looked at the SD card, only the previous day's images were displayed in the Finder/File Explorer. Yet the SD card was showing as almost full, so I suspected the data had been stored (even if not listed as files). Fortunately I had previously purchased a data recovery software (Disk Drill) which allowed me to recover about 80% of the images directly, and another 10% after a deeper scan. So 6714 images were saved from yesterday's mission, not as many as I wanted (probably lost 600) but at least I didn't lose a full day of my life cycling on my Brompton in circles around the fancy houses of Woluwe for nothing. 

TL;DR: almost lost a full day of work because Mapillary uploaded corrupted the file system of my SD card. Always reformat the card before going out !

Tue, Aug 2, 2022, 00:54:42 - Peter Elderson NL: I've done another 360 test run, one and a half hours walking @ 5 sec interval.  Camera on gooseneck on vented helmet, with tiewraps to keep the camera fixed. https://www.mapillary.com/app/?pKey=626772348605071
Tue, Aug 2, 2022, 01:08:14 - Peter Elderson NL: I think the result is promising, but not ideal. The fixation works. 5 seconds, I think it's too fast for the long stretches. Where there are turns, bends and corners, of a specific detail I want to capture, I still have to slow down or even stop for one interval. 
The resolution is fine for the larger features, like landuse, surface, water, buildings, fences and barriers, and even street signs, but it is far too low for e.g. the numbers on the node network poles or the names/labels on GR-stickers. 
For those I may have to get close and stop for one interval, to capture the labels. Or, use a second device e.g. a handy with the mapillary app, to capture fine details. 
I have looked at Kartaview, but it doesn't get close to being user-friendly enough. I'm talking dummy-user here.

Tue, Aug 16, 2022, 13:05:31 - timcouwelier: selling access to the data is their bussiness model, and the fewer end users look at the data all the time, the lower the costs on their end.
Tue, Aug 16, 2022, 13:06:12 - timcouwelier: When the contract through AIV ended, all municipalities received a letter saying they could retain access to the (by then relatively old) data, at a rather hefty fee...
Tue, Aug 16, 2022, 13:06:57 - timcouwelier: Annoyingly enough, the tenders for such projects seem to undervalue the 'ownership rights' of the actual imagery
Tue, Aug 16, 2022, 13:07:11 - timcouwelier: which means you're buying a service, rather then the imagery.
Sat, Aug 20, 2022, 17:36:16 - joost_schouppe: At state of the Map, I just did a lightning talk about our project. someone pointed out that there's a new project in France to host images. They might be interested in ours. Info at https://gitlab.com/PanierAvide/geovisio

Not because the letter got lost, but because when you expect only one SD card, it's easy to miss that there's actually two in the letter. So if you send SD cards in a letter, best to tape it shut inside some piece of carton or paper. And let the recipient know how many cards to expect!

Thu, Sep 8, 2022, 12:19:20 - Seppe: The weeping part comes from the feeling I had watching the movie that this is tax payer's money going straight to a giant private player. But as you now, Somme Tourisme is not the only one who has done it this way üôà

For a DMO (Destination Marketing Organizaion), it would make more sense to upload the imagery to different platforms, including the closed ones that are 'incontournable' like Google. I'll try to look further into what it takes to become 'certified' by Google. It could mean an improvment for both the quality and the quantity of the images that Westtoer puts out there.

Thu, Sep 8, 2022, 19:38:31 - joost_schouppe: Dirk Dedoncker (with whom I'm sharing gopro max 1) has a project in a Limburg municipality, and will be doing 360 that as well

Fri, Sep 16, 2022, 15:02:19 - joost_schouppe: Indoor isn't going to work with any GPS AFAIK 
Fri, Sep 16, 2022, 15:03:03 - joost_schouppe: But I suppose it's possible to fake coordinates in such a way that mapillary believes them
Fri, Sep 16, 2022, 15:12:33 - thierry.js1030 invited Rapha√´l_PasLoin
Fri, Sep 16, 2022, 16:02:06 - Thibaultmol: Yeah indoor is going to be a mess honestly. Not really sure what a good solution there would be.
Wifi has a system for positioning but pretty much no acces points have it yet and even then, it's not meant to replace gps.


Fri, Sep 16, 2022, 16:02:22 - Thibaultmol: Curious what the exact application to use this in is
Fri, Sep 16, 2022, 16:06:26 - Thibaultmol: If the plan is to map the inside of a building (similar to how there are commercial services that come map your building for google maps) and so you want something to map the inside of the building as you're recording it with the gopro. Then you could use an iphone or ipad that has the lidar sensor combined with a floorplanning app. You can probably then see what route you took trough the building maybe
Fri, Sep 16, 2022, 16:07:02 - Thibaultmol: oh wait it's not a 360 cam. So i guess that's not what you're asking;.. hmmm.. I dunno then. Even high end phones can't do actual gps inside of buildings well

Sat, Sep 17, 2022, 16:48:13 - Thibaultmol: (already mentioned this in the hackmd doc) weekend of 15-16 oct I'll be in antwerp with not much going on. Could spend the days recording 360 footage with one of the max's. 
Sat, Sep 17, 2022, 16:54:56 - joost_schouppe: That should be doable 
Sat, Sep 17, 2022, 16:58:48 - Thibaultmol: I figured it'd mention it now so that it can 'reserved'
Sat, Sep 17, 2022, 17:04:24 - joost_schouppe: Yeah... I just asked pelderson how he's doing, haven't heard from Jim in a while. Dirk and I are still making heavy use of one together. Number three is in Braine l'Alleud with eMzerh. I might ask him to send it over. There's a couple more people in the queue who asked for short periods, maybe we can move the tempo up a bit. Only downside is that it'll spend a lot of time traveling (packages are a little slow)

He also uses an sd card offloader device (have heard of this brand before somewhere) https://www.nextodi.com/products/ncb-20/
(basically you attach it to a usb drive and plug in your sd cards. it then auto transfers to the usb drive, auto labels the files so you know which sd card they came from. And can optionally wipe the sd cards so they're ready to use again.

Wed, Oct 12, 2022, 16:28:58 - St√©phane De Greef: When I was shooting with inverted cameras, I used the uploader with the parameter 180¬∞ rotation

Wed, Oct 12, 2022, 16:31:11 - St√©phane De Greef: I was using interpolate THEN applying 180 for inverted images
Wed, Oct 12, 2022, 16:32:14 - St√©phane De Greef: The Mapillary uploader app now automatically applies the interpolation
Wed, Oct 12, 2022, 16:34:03 - joost_schouppe: I wonder if in the command line that means doing --interpolate_directions --offset_angle 180
Wed, Oct 12, 2022, 16:38:59 - St√©phane De Greef: I believe so
Wed, Oct 12, 2022, 17:22:33 - joost_schouppe: well I gave it a shot, we'll see
Thu, Oct 13, 2022, 21:18:36 - Thibaultmol: Figured while I have the cam, and I have a diy lightbox (for product photography) I could make a little tut (or atleast make the images for one) on how to use the helmet mount.
(ignore the colors, those will get corrected once I edit them)
Q:

1. Which way should the Max face?
2. in which way should the plastic mount, that the gopro attaches to) be used? (like how I did it in the top left image there?)
3. Did I attach the straps correctly?

Also, this way I had way too much helmet all around on the pictures. I don't need to see my toes or my nose, but I do want to see what's on the ground in front of me. So I used a 20 cm gooseneck between the helmet mount and the camera. This also allowed me to position the camera exacty over the middle of the helmet when wearing it. I needed someone else to fix the position from all directions while I had the helmet on and held my head straight. And I used two very tight tiewraps so the mount couldn't get loose. Only then I got acceptable footage!

Fri, Oct 14, 2022, 08:46:10 - Seppe: The piece that is included with the OSM.be bicycle set is a bit different (see Thibaultmol's pictures above). It puts the camera higher, so the amount of helmet on the pictures is acceptable IMO
Fri, Oct 14, 2022, 08:51:41 - Seppe: Thibaultmol: 
1) the screen of the camera should face to the back. Be aware: the camera can also switch orientation, as Joost explained just before. The short manual points this out
2) You can turn the plastic piece either way. By putting it in the one or the other position, you can usually compensate a little bit if vent holes (and thus the straps) are a bit too much to the front or to the back of your hands
3) I did it like you did, but I also wished they would stay a bit more firmly attached. That's why i permanently stuck an adhesive mount on my helmet
Fri, Oct 14, 2022, 09:00:01 - joost_schouppe: On my helmet, it didn't really loosen much at all with this setup. It's different of course if you put the camera higher. Also, I put the loose end of the straps in a sort of knot around the base, so they don't flap in the wind, into the camera view
Fri, Oct 14, 2022, 09:43:01 - Thibaultmol: The mount does slide around a bit (not sure why they didn't put silicone or rubber on that mount... Would have caused much less movement).
But yeah, i technically have a gorilla pod. So tried a thing

Fri, Oct 14, 2022, 20:25:31 - St√©phane De Greef: Not much. I delete the stuff I know were shot when I was fixing my chain or talking to someone or things like that. I remember globally what parts I want deleted based on where I was and the dot clouds on the Mapillary uploader map. I click a pic in the problem areas then look up the filename and delete the sequence before upload.
Fri, Oct 14, 2022, 20:28:09 - joost_schouppe: I open them in Irfanview and do a slideshow as quickly as possible. I delete duplicates and weird stuff as I go. With the Hero, I open "large preview" in Explorer and scroll through them as fast as possible. The first approach would take too long with Hero imagery, as it is 4 times as much (so you don't want to be hitting delete for every single image)

Fri, Oct 14, 2022, 21:30:54 - Thibaultmol: green helmet is mine, with the extended height.
So a bit more visibility of the ground.
with the downside I guess that small movements have bigger impacts on the extended height mounting?
Fri, Oct 14, 2022, 21:39:35 - Peter Elderson NL: <@thibaultmol:matrix.org "green helmet is mine, with the e..."> Yes, stability of the whole helmet was a point- De voering van mijn oude helm was prut, rubberstrips ontbreken, dus met die camera erop schoof het ding gewoon opzij van mijn hoofd af. Ik heb een pet opgezet dan pas de helm, en de kinband stevig aangetrokken, ik had nog net voldoende lucht. Maar in het gebruik leerde mijn hoofd zichzelf om de boel recht te houden. Tot ik door het struikgewas moest en gevallen bomen moest passeren... Voor de beelden maakten de bewegingen niet uit, hoe ze het doen weet ik niet maar ik had bijna geen bewogen foto's.

Sat, Oct 15, 2022, 09:20:34 - Seppe: The difference in lighting between front and back camera can be annoying.
Sat, Oct 15, 2022, 09:36:17 - Seppe: If aynone knows a trick to prevent this, let us know
Sat, Oct 15, 2022, 23:16:16 - Thibaultmol: I think (because of how the auto stitching works in the overlap regions) the only solution would be to layer on top, an image with the brightness increases you want. And the transition built in. I can give it a go. But there is no easy way to automate something like that. Only a way to auto apply it to a set of images all at once. But that brightness difference will vary of course
Fri, Oct 21, 2022, 21:41:54 - FranBAG: Do you know the software [Hugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugin_(software))¬†?
I talked about it to pierreserpe and it handles wavy horizons in two or three clicks.
I think Pierre managed to correct a batch of pictures with a given angle (due to not correct _but almost constant_ angle of the camera on top of the helmet) with a script. I never got that far.
I'm convinced there is a way to correct the lighting also but I never did it.
I could try if you give me a picture with a lighting problem.
Fri, Oct 21, 2022, 21:54:35 - Seppe: interesting!
Fri, Oct 21, 2022, 22:34:06 - Thibaultmol: I was looking into Hugin again for fixing the angles (but it would be best to just modify the EXIF data without actually changing the image itself)
Fri, Oct 21, 2022, 22:34:21 - Thibaultmol: but can't seem to make Hugin work with 360 images
Fri, Oct 21, 2022, 22:44:15 - FranBAG: As I loaded an image from Pierre, Hugin recognized immediately that it was a 360¬∞ one and covered the whole sphere with it.
I didn't do anything special for this. Then I went to the tab _‚Äúmove/drag‚Äù_ and took a (maximum/minimum) point of the horizon to the ‚Äú0¬∞‚Äù horizontal line to correct the tilt. Then _exported_.
And, of course, a correction of the tilt angle in the EXIF data is much better. (I didn't know it was possible.)
But I talked about Hugin to address the lighting problem‚Ä¶ I just had a rapid look at the options and I'm afraid Hugin will consider the picture as ONE picture and won't allow to modify the lightning of _half a picture_.  :-/
Sorry.
Sat, Oct 22, 2022, 14:17:43 - Thibaultmol: So just to demonstrate, what I meant a couple days ago was this:
Because the places where the front and back cam attach are always in the same place. It might be possible to just use a brightness increase layer with it.
So as an example:

Sat, Oct 22, 2022, 14:20:23 - Thibaultmol: (just now realized I probably made that gradient on the right bigger than the left, whoops)
But that just gets placed on top of the original. And the brightness gets increased based on how white/transparant that ontop layer is.

I guess you might have to experiment a bit and see. 
this site is great to show you when different levels of sunrise/sunset are. I think 'civil twilight' is probably the minimum?

the camera being backwards is not ideal. If you were to just upload it to mapillary it would be incorrect. But iirc in the mapillary uploader you can manually offeset the compass direction to fix this? (someone double check if that's the right procedure)
Wed, Dec 7, 2022, 09:16:04 - Thibaultmol: <@kvde:matrix.org "Will the image quality be better..."> the image does look a little blurry, but that might because the lenses got water on  them because of the fog.

Thu, Dec 8, 2022, 14:05:11 - joost_schouppe: BTW we got word from Mapillary that the low frame rate (1 image per 2 seconds) is limiting the capability of detecting traffic signs. Using the command line tool, it should now be possible to just upload video instead. Anyone want to experiment with that? (one of y'all could make the video, someone else could try the upload.

Fri, Dec 9, 2022, 09:13:32 - Thibaultmol: Sorry, what I meant was: regarding the thing you said about Mapillary saying the low fps of the max is hindering good sign detection.

If  normal gopro + max 2s timelapse mode > just a Max in video mode

Fri, Dec 9, 2022, 11:35:47 - Thibaultmol: if so: yeah. That's a problem with gopro's for some reason. Sometimes they'll save an image. with the correct hour and seconds, but the minute amount won't have gone +1

So you'll get these timestamps in order of capture:
18:10:56
18:10:58
18:10:00
18:11:02
18:11:04

So Mapillary will place that image with the wrong timecode in a the 'correct' order that it thinks is right
Fri, Dec 9, 2022, 19:30:09 - joost_schouppe: pierreserpe: from what I understand from the mapillary crew, I think it can be done entirely server-side. So just run the first command in this section: https://github.com/mapillary/mapillary_tools#upload-videos
Sat, Dec 10, 2022, 10:56:49 - thierry.js1030: hello kvde here 2 examples where the quality is enough for traffig sign-recognition:
1) https://www.mapillary.com/app/?pKey=531577102198469 -> should be F45b (cyclists and pedestrians can go through) and not F45
2) https://www.mapillary.com/app/?pKey=507987587776268 -> you can clearly read 'Verboden toegang'

Mon, Dec 12, 2022, 11:25:39 - kvde: I think the F45 sign is correct. The path you see on the map goes straigt through a playground. I don't think we want poeple to cycle through that.
Mon, Dec 12, 2022, 12:10:38 - thierry.js1030: <@kvde:matrix.org "I think the F45 sign is correct...."> 1) it's not up to "us" to decide if cyclists are allowed or not
2) even if cyclist's would not be allowed, you can still indicate that pedestrians can go through ... it's also F45b and with the symbol of a pedestrian without a cyclist ... üôÇ

Wed, Dec 14, 2022, 15:53:09 - pierreserpe: Hi Joost, I have the feeling that the method only works for standard video. Panoramic/360 video is not willing to upload. I also tried to process the video with the help. GoPro videos: Sample GoPro videos in directory path/to/videos/ into import path path/to/sample_images/ at a sampling rate 0.5 seconds, i.e. two frames every second, and process resulting video frames in path/to/videos/sample_images/.

mapillary_tools video_process "path/to/videos/" "path/to/sample_images/" \
    --geotag_source "gopro_videos" \
    --interpolate_directions \
    --video_sample_interval 0.5
Wed, Dec 14, 2022, 15:54:00 - kvde: expensive but valueable for the municipalities. Driving around to go on site is also expensive. My biggest point of critisism is that the municipalities don't own the data. And that means that at some point in time they can lose access to this valueable service.

Wed, Dec 21, 2022, 09:33:58 - kvde: How does the processing of the traffic sign recognition work. I see that my imagery from 7 december generated some automatic recognitions but not all. For example this sign isn't recognized but it did get a nice frame around it. Do I have to wait for more processing or will this sign never show up in the automatic recognized list?

Wed, Dec 21, 2022, 10:05:36 - Thibaultmol: - Are you sure you have all street objects selected in the mapillary interface?
- It might have just detected it as a traffic sign, but doesn't know which one
Wed, Dec 21, 2022, 10:51:14 - joost_schouppe: I've seen this in some 360 imagery as well. General input from mapillary for now is that they do need several images of a single sign to be able to pinpoint it. This is what Vincent B mentioned during his talk at foss4g/sotmbe and unfortunately turns out to be true
Wed, Dec 21, 2022, 10:52:06 - joost_schouppe: So if you want to be sure they detect ALL the signs, you need to go slow, we need to try the video uploading or we need a traditional GoPro as well
Wed, Dec 21, 2022, 10:57:35 - kvde: the downside of making videos is that the image quality is lower. So to make good images and recognize traffic signs we need two camera's mounted on top of eachother?
Wed, Dec 21, 2022, 11:06:08 - kvde: The traffic signs are a major selling point for municipalities.

Mon, Jan 2, 2023, 18:30:36 - Marc_marc: feedback from my first use of the GoProMax :
- it's not obvious how to remove the cap of the 2 lenses (I didn't know if it's screwed or clipped... and as it's very well clipped, I was afraid to force it), it would be convenient to communicate this to the new user
- wouldn't it be useful to include a mini SD-usb reader? 
- all cameras are with bike helmet mount?
Mon, Jan 2, 2023, 18:33:21 - joost_schouppe: For 1: could you add that to Google drive doc?

I'm afraid that if I want to get someone to ride all the streets in a municipality that the helmet mounted setup is to heavy and will get shot down by our safety coordinator.
Tue, Jan 3, 2023, 08:50:27 - Thibaultmol: too heavy? are you doing more than just mounting the gopro max  on the helmet?  I don't think it's that heavy, right?
Tue, Jan 3, 2023, 09:14:26 - kvde: Like I said I'm afraid we will get into this discussion and asking the question is answering it. If I think he might say no that means it needs to be investigated and that means no. 
Tue, Jan 3, 2023, 09:29:15 - Seppe: Using the helmet for walking has the disadvantage that you kinda have to keep your head straight (in 3 axes) the whole time. If you have a good backpack setup, you can at least turn your head around as much as you like. 
Tue, Jan 3, 2023, 09:30:28 - Seppe: <@Seppe:matrix.org "sent an image."> This was my attempt which worked very well but was just a one off (with a cardboard tube and lots of straps holding it together)
Tue, Jan 3, 2023, 09:32:04 - Seppe: see the results e.g. [here](https://www.mapillary.com/app/?pKey=1384887041952123)
Tue, Jan 3, 2023, 09:33:31 - Seppe: A colleague will try to make something that has the size of a laptop so you can slide it into a laptop backpack. That would make it easy to share with different people
Tue, Jan 3, 2023, 10:48:56 - Peter Elderson NL: The helmet mount is certainly not too heavy. I had a gooseneck on the helmet, then the GoPro on top of it, and had no problem whatsoever with the weight.
I tried a backpack setup using a straight hollow pole and the gopro on to of that. The fixation sort of worked, but to get the gopro centered over my head was a problem. With the pole straight up I had the balding top of my head featuring on all the snapshots. I could fixate the pole tilted forward, but then the pole was bumping against the back of my head all the time.
I could have used the gooseneck on top of the pole. But that would make for a long, top heavy setup, high tilt force so swaying a lot.
Tue, Jan 3, 2023, 11:03:07 - Peter Elderson NL: <@Seppe:matrix.org "Using the helmet for walking has..."> That's what I thought in advance... turned out that the head keeps itself reasonably straight all the time, while the backpack swings, tilts and sways with all body movements. The only thing your head does more than your back, is turning around the vertical axis. When crossing a road you have to turn your head multiple times. But in the resulting photo sequence that is not really a problem! 
1. You have 360 all around anyway, 
2. Most of the head turns are outside the timed snapshots, 
3. It's not a problem to have intermediate photos looking to the sides when there is actually something to see, such as a crossing road with mappable elements such as street signs, markings, kerbs, hedges, traffic calming features, crossing islands, buildings/natural/landuse.
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 11:50:03 - kvde: what's the flow to process video 360 images? How do I trim the start and end of the ride? Do I transform the video into images?
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 11:58:34 - Seppe: <@kvde:matrix.org "what's the flow to process video..."> We usually don't make videos, but use the timelapse mode, see [the minimanual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mu27MJlwgXL0vBnF3Nfn2my8AIU-dOYl/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true) for more details. 
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 11:58:59 - Seppe: Trimming is then as easy as just deleting a few photos at the beginning and end if necessary
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 12:01:02 - kvde: I know. But this doesn't get good results with traffic sign recognition. And this is a requirment to convince the municipalities (Laakdal) I work at to spend the time to ride all the roads. I'm using the OSM gopro as a proof of concept to convince them to buy one.
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 12:02:11 - kvde: (and start sharing the images)
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 12:05:46 - Seppe: Ah yes, sorry, I missed that info.
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 12:12:10 - Marc_marc: maybe the best is to convert the video into a pack of photos, then delete what you want
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 12:25:38 - joost_schouppe: The mapillary_tools should be able to turn video into images, so trimming should be done in advance
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 13:50:07 - kvde: So the gopro app doesn't allow editing on the 360 video:
"Photo Bursts and 360 Media are not supported at this time"
The problem with using mapillary_tool is that this is going from "I can teach this to people with basic IT skills" to "I have to do it myself"
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 14:00:15 - Marc_marc: what do you want to cut ? the 1s meters for privaty reason ? or bad photo (for ex I have deleted photo with my fingers starting the shoot) ?
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 15:03:09 - kvde: first and last meters for privacy reasons. I got in the habit of turning on the camera and then putting on my helmet. I also turn it on early and leave it on for long enough. It's very easy to delete these pictures in GeoSetter. I would also like to delete duplicates when I stopped for a traffic light, ...
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 15:03:42 - kvde: In short I would like to clean up the data in GeoSetter.
Wed, Jan 4, 2023, 18:53:56 - joost_schouppe: While the initial setup of the mapillary_tools is a little complicated, once it works anyone can do it. Just a matter of copy pasting the right command. 
Tue, Jan 10, 2023, 08:25:08 - Thibaultmol: Even apple doesn't succeed in correctly blurring all license plates: https://twitter.com/intidc/status/1612707414939439104/
Tue, Jan 10, 2023, 08:49:50 - kvde: I can't seem to find a single non blurred plate on the images I uploaded. And there is a way to report images without logging in. If you're logged in you can even add blurred sections yourself. So Mapillary does better than Apple but is it enough? 
Tue, Jan 10, 2023, 08:50:07 - kvde: Do we want to ask that question to Inti?
Tue, Jan 10, 2023, 10:43:47 - Marc_marc: in my opinion the real solution would be to blur the images before sending them because you never know what a company is doing with your photos. the problem is that it takes time AND there is a lack of tools (I don't have for example a software to edit a 360¬∞ photo). fred had done some interesting tests of machine-learning and blurring
Tue, Jan 10, 2023, 10:54:12 - kvde: That would be the best solution. That way if you keep the pictures to upload them to another service in the future they are already privacy minded in your archive.

Mon, Jan 16, 2023, 08:51:05 - kvde: I spoke to someone at [WVI](https://www.wvi.be) on friday to share some experiences with 360¬∞ imagery. He said their Data protection officer said to not put the camera above 2m high because of privacy concerns. Does anyone have an idea where this height comes from? Is there a law somewhere that says this?
Mon, Jan 16, 2023, 09:02:05 - Thibaultmol: (no idea about the law) but the idea of making a law around the max eye height of most people, could make sense yeah
Mon, Jan 16, 2023, 09:07:06 - kvde: I find this a completely reasonable requirement so I have no issue following this but I want to know where it comes from.

Mon, Jan 16, 2023, 09:23:51 - kvde: I didn't measure my camera height yet. I assumed it was below 2m
Mon, Jan 16, 2023, 09:30:36 - Thibaultmol: Sent the question to Ministry of Privacy (non profit org in belgium for privacy stuff)
Mon, Jan 16, 2023, 22:49:17 - Seppe: I vaguely remembered something about Google looking over fences that I found confirmed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View_privacy_concerns):

> On May 13, 2009, Google Japan announced that it would modify their cameras to scan from a lower height of 2.05 meters above ground level, 95 centimeters lower than the original height of the camera head. The new height is intended to avoid having cameras view over fences in front of homes and into homes. This reduced height is to apply immediately, and all areas previously visited will be rescanned from the reduced height. Scans taken at the original height will remain available until they are replaced with the new images.
Tue, Jan 17, 2023, 09:19:15 - Thibaultmol: Has anybody here now tried uploading video to mapillary?
(saw someone on twitter using a gopro as a 'dashcam' for his bike. I'm DMing him to talk about mapillary xd)
Tue, Jan 17, 2023, 09:20:28 - thierry.js1030: I will do this week
Tue, Jan 17, 2023, 09:31:04 - kvde: I will do it when I find the time to process the video. My other responsibilities at work are a little more urgent. I have a video ready and got IT to install python so it should be straight forward from now on.
Tue, Jan 17, 2023, 22:47:27 - timcouwelier: If gopro video works well in experiments, do let me know.
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 08:21:10 - kvde: my main goal now is to get traffic sign recognition working. All other use cases rely mostly on just looking at the images. So in that sense I am focussing on a process to gather the images and using them. I was trying to find a shortest path over all roads within a municipality but that turns out to be a hard question to answer.
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 09:25:35 - joost_schouppe: I also struggled with this problem before. I found this http://www.everystreetchallenge.com/ . It is limited to a small area, but if you run it locally it might be tweaked to allow a larger area. Understanding it was beyond the time I was willing to invest in it though
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 09:59:44 - kvde: ow god, another rabbit hole to do down.

Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 10:22:54 - joost_schouppe: yes, you need the command line tool

Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 10:46:12 - joost_schouppe: kvde: did you try out https://gopro.com/en/us/info/gopro-player in the end?
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 10:46:45 - kvde: No, I was looking at the mapillary tools. But no time yet to test it
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 10:47:38 - joost_schouppe: I think that tool should work to cut of the beginning & the end. Unfortunately I can't just install this on my work pc
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 10:48:31 - kvde: With the pictures I always did some cleanup of the pictures. you don't need 5 pictures of the same red light, ...
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 11:00:24 - Thibaultmol: I could be wrong, but i'm pretty sure that gopro player will cut the video but has to reencode the entire video. which means that another layer of recompression will happen. What I remember doing many years ago was using the command line tool ffmpeg (the most popular video command line tool) to cut the video. 
The resulting video is technically going to be corrupt in the first second or so because it got cut where it was expecting a keyframe (video encoding basically does a keyframe every so many frames and then just delta frames to tell what's different from the original keyframe. if it has delta frames but not the original keyframe, it won't be able to do  that first second BUT the rest of the video stays untouched)
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 11:02:48 - Thibaultmol: But you can configure ffmpeg to find the nearest keyframe as well.

So this little script should make it very easy (open notepad and save this as script.bat)
Open the video in any video player and input the start time and the end time of the video when prompted by the script and it will output the cut video:
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 11:03:01 - Thibaultmol: ```
@echo off
echo Enter the original file name:
set /p file_name=
echo Enter the start time of the video in hh:mm:ss or mm:ss format
set /p start_time=
echo Enter the end time of the video in hh:mm:ss or mm:ss format
set /p end_time=

set output_file=%file_name:~0,-4%-trimmed%file_name:~-4%

echo Trimming video...

ffmpeg -i %file_name% -ss %start_time% -to %end_time% -c copy -copyts -avoid_negative_ts 1 -progress - -y %output_file%

echo Video trim complete. Output file: %output_file%
```

Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 11:10:01 - joost_schouppe: so we just need a video player that can show .360 files and to install ffmpeg (I remember struggling with that, but I think I have it now)
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 11:10:22 - Thibaultmol: Honestly with chatgpt, ffmpeg becomes easy XD
Wed, Jan 18, 2023, 11:36:40 - Thibaultmol: Actually, with Powershell scripts you can even make it so that you can drag the video into the window. So you run the script and drag the mp4 on top of the window and it knows where it is:
I think this should do it. Paste this in notepad and save it as a .ps1

Sat, Jan 21, 2023, 08:45:27 - joost_schouppe: I had an unfortunate incident yesterday. I had only just put the GoPro Hero on the car, when suddenly it disappeared under the car. I wasn't going fast, but there were some cars behind me. At least one of them hit it full on. Incredibly, the camera itself did not sustain injury (nor the cars), but the suction cup thingy is a total loss. As to causes: I remember thinking "hmm the cups aren't exactly level", the car was a little dirty from standing close to the sea shore for a while, and Lore said she had the feeling the cups were getting old. This is after 4 years and several thousand km without incident.
Sat, Jan 21, 2023, 08:59:15 - thierry.js1030: so is the camera still "usable" or not?
Sat, Jan 21, 2023, 09:45:30 - Thibaultmol: Gopro's are tough as sh*t but lenses are always glass... so the lens might have some scratches on it. On the Max that would be pretty devestating. 
On the recent regular Gopro, atleast there's the advantage of being able to swap out the lenses. (assuming nothing touched the actual image sensor underneath)

Thu, Jan 26, 2023, 10:08:45 - joost_schouppe: python 11? You mean Python 3.11?
Thu, Jan 26, 2023, 10:09:56 - kvde: yes, 3.11 vs 3.10

Thu, Feb 2, 2023, 12:22:41 - stijn_claes: For those who already used the OSM-cameras: do you format the SD-card each time after you've copied the imagery to your laptop and uploaded the imagery to Mapillary, or do you keep them on the SD-card for a while? And do you do the formatting via the Preferences of the camera itself or via your Windows Explorer (if you use Windows) when the SD-card is introduced in your laptop or computer?
Thu, Feb 2, 2023, 12:25:58 - joost_schouppe: I format after each use. It's not absolutely necessary, but it feels safer. I use the device to format

Mon, Mar 6, 2023, 11:43:25 - stijn_claes: I can imagine that this setup with the camera oriented towards the sides will raise more questions to people you are passing by (a camera oriented forwards-backwards will rather be considered as a camera to register your own safety, but the other orientation clearly indicates you are photographing something else)

He only today realized that anybody can download the (near) full res version of his images, and because of the CC BY SA license on mapillary. Anybody can use it for personal and commercial use. 

Now he wants all his images deleted...

Sat, Mar 11, 2023, 14:46:24 - Thibaultmol: Because the images are CC BY SA, I could download them and archive them. BUT turns out that mapillary's api is an actual dumpster fire. documentation is innacurate and has so many lacking features.

You need to look at the code of the mapillary webapp, see the hardcoded api key they use. and use that key to request the api for the user id

You can also test the horizon level 'sort of live': take the posture you would take when riding your bike. Then connect the GoPro to your smartphone and switch between front and back view. There should be half of the image above and half beneath the horizon on both sides.

Wed, Mar 29, 2023, 14:20:44 - Thibaultmol: on the mapillary website you can download the appimage
Wed, Mar 29, 2023, 14:20:45 - Thibaultmol: If you're familiar with installing non-mac-app-store software on a mac, it's similar. You don't really install an appimage, you generally just start/launch an appimage.

So what I would recommend that you do is install a separate package that basically gives you a popup when you run an appimage, to add a shortcut to it in your usual applications menu:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:appimagelauncher-team/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install appimagelauncher
```

And then just download the mapillary appimage, open it and you should get the popup to add it to your programs
Wed, Mar 29, 2023, 14:21:16 - Thibaultmol: https://tools.mapillary.com/uploader/download/linux
Wed, Mar 29, 2023, 14:22:57 - Thibaultmol: (opinion: Ubuntu is what everybody thinks of when you mean 'linux' but it actually has a bunch of problems and the company behind it doesn't really care about it's desktop users anymore.
If you want a good desktop experience, install something like PopOS. With PopOS you have the advantage of having more stability and more software available (Flatpak is becoming the new standard for installing software on linux, and that's included on PopOS and included in it's software center equivelant)
Sun, Apr 2, 2023, 13:50:57 - Marc_marc: one more standard :) none of the major distributions have switched to flak https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png
Mon, Apr 3, 2023, 15:18:47 - Thibaultmol: not all distro's are 'switching' to flatpak only... that's also not the point. There's still a need for regular packages. but many distro's have it as an option or make it a one click thing.
(fyi, nearly no other distro has snap support... except ubuntu itself..)
Mon, Apr 3, 2023, 15:20:39 - Thibaultmol: Fedora, linux minut, zorin, manjaro, redhat, suse, popos... and those honestly are the major ones.. all have flatpak support by default.
And the others have the ability to enable it in a couple commands...

Reality is: flatpak is easier to package for than native packages. Meaning that certain software devs that didn't bother with linux support before, can actually be bothered now
Mon, Apr 3, 2023, 18:01:52 - Marc_marc: support by default but not by default using flatpak, so if you have firefox "native" and a flakpak that need a browser (or vice-versa), you have a dependency issue
Mon, Apr 3, 2023, 18:04:13 - Marc_marc: and i'm not against a universal package format, on the contrary, it's not practical to have the XYZ app available for one distribution but not for another... but dependency resolution is complicated, around fedora/rhel there were even repositories that didn't name the packages exactly the same, dependency issue again
Mon, Apr 3, 2023, 20:30:20 - Thibaultmol: flatpak handles the dependencies though. that's the beauty of it

Sun, Apr 9, 2023, 12:09:42 - stijn_claes: Does someone edit their images before / after uploading to Mapillary, e.g. when driving in sunny conditions, images could be dark sometimes, so you might want to lighten them up

Sun, Apr 9, 2023, 14:31:52 - St√©phane De Greef: The GoPro player allows for some editing but I rarely do so considering the huge amount of data I'm going through (oh and the fact I have no more computer üòÖ)

Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 20:59:25 - stijn_claes: Another question: is there the possibility to ask Mapillary to blur certain houses like they do in Google Streetview? Did someone already had problems regarding 'the privacy questions'? kvde and I will be presenting the few acquisitions we did with the OSM-camera to the local GIS coordinators of the Kempen region and I'm expecting also these kind of questions since Mapillary-imagery is publicly available (acquisitions private companies such as Cyclomedia or Image-V are doing for local governments can only be used internally by the local government and are not publicly available)
Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 21:01:55 - St√©phane De Greef: There's a way to edit blurs 
Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 21:01:56 - thierry.js1030: "is there the possibility to ask Mapillary to blur certain houses" -> good question!  I actually don't know ...
Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 21:02:38 - St√©phane De Greef: If I log into my account I can add/edit blur of my own pics. I never tried though.
Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 21:02:43 - joost_schouppe: We actually had a question like this from a TomTom user. But it turned out to be some other source than Mapillary or Google
Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 21:03:22 - joost_schouppe: Anyone can suggest any blurring. But I've never seen a blurred house
Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 21:04:03 - St√©phane De Greef: Probably because people worried about privacy don't know Mapillary exists üòÖ

Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 21:17:15 - stijn_claes: For aerial imagery, there is a clear boundary in which a maximum level of detail is defined. I also see that Google Streetview also seems to respect these boundaries, but if I pass at the edge of the military domain in my municipality tomorrow, there is nothing that limits me to upload 360¬∞ imagery which also visualize a part of the military domain (which one also can see with the naked eye from the public road of course)
Mon, Apr 10, 2023, 21:17:54 - stijn_claes: Am I doing something illegal at that moment?

Tue, Apr 11, 2023, 03:22:05 - Rapha√´l_PasLoin: And 118 talk about communication of the data , not the fact of taking the data , it's a little difference. (but for mp it will be suspicious)  And for Nuclear installation (classe I)  and Sensitive area that the gouvernement decide it's clearly different : taking data is forbiden.  For some military installation there is some tolerance (Spotting/pics plane and background in Beauvechain for exemple)
Tue, Apr 11, 2023, 09:54:40 - stijn_claes: so if I understand correctly, I better delete the 360¬∞-imagery which I took when I passed by (on a public road) the military domain of Grobbendonk

Tue, Apr 11, 2023, 10:28:06 - joost_schouppe: I guess the pro-active thing to do would be to ask the government whose responsibility it is to keep those images offline
Tue, Apr 11, 2023, 10:38:25 - stijn_claes: Government being NGI (part of defense) in this case?
Tue, Apr 11, 2023, 14:39:06 - St√©phane De Greef: Most likely they would know
Tue, Apr 11, 2023, 14:43:47 - stijn_claes: If we ask them, they possibly will also have a look on data which is already on there...
Fri, Apr 14, 2023, 11:20:08 - Marc_marc: it's a bit prehistoric to believe that security through obfuscation works, the russians know very well where the nato headquarters is and probably have as many photos as they feel they need. but as a precaution to avoid trouble (and especially bad publicity), it would make sense to censor oneself by not posting such photos
Fri, Apr 14, 2023, 11:21:23 - Marc_marc: and maybe better to do yourself than waiting that the gov delete too much by lack of mastery of the tools to precisely target the problem
Sat, Apr 15, 2023, 21:27:22 - stijn_claes: Can you see somewhere if Mapillary has some backlog? Normally map update is done 1 or 2 days after upload, but the images I uploaded on Tuesday and which are published the day after still not show up on the map
Sat, Apr 15, 2023, 21:37:58 - St√©phane De Greef: Worst I had was 4-5 days between upload and display.
Sat, Apr 15, 2023, 21:43:54 - stijn_claes: I see that you also did some uploads on Tuesday which are not yet shown on the map
Sat, Apr 15, 2023, 21:45:16 - St√©phane De Greef: Yup
Sat, Apr 15, 2023, 21:48:21 - stijn_claes: It probably is because I'm waiting on it to send the link to some colleagues :-)
Sat, Apr 15, 2023, 21:52:48 - St√©phane De Greef: I'm about to upload another 45km now. We'll see how long it takes to display.
Sat, Apr 15, 2023, 21:53:40 - stijn_claes: You should drive some while in the Kempen :-)
Sat, Apr 15, 2023, 22:17:53 - St√©phane De Greef: Anyone has a magic tool to batch modify the exif of images? All my GoPro dates from today are in 2016. Apparently the date was lost when I changed the battery.

Sun, Apr 16, 2023, 10:47:59 - eMerzh: Hello all the folks here üëã...
i noticed that some folks of osm-fr and IGN have started a project https://panoramax.fr/ about photo-mapping... 
it's still a bit early , but i was wondering how we could maybe help or contribute... either by hosting an instance (once ready ofc) or throwing or pictures or help buildin the thing 
Sun, Apr 16, 2023, 11:55:21 - stijn_claes: I think it is related to the Geovisio-project which already was discussed here somewhere. Some folks here did follow this up...
Sun, Apr 16, 2023, 17:55:20 - Marc_marc: early ? that's one way of looking at it, the fundraising to start a PoC was done about 4 years ago... the worry is that the project got bogged down in the hands of overworked people, now that the coding is done by others, it should progress
Sun, Apr 16, 2023, 18:18:06 - Jonathan: <@emerzh:matrix.org "Hello all the folks here üëã..."> We joined an OSMFR (online) meeting to discuss this a few months ago.
The idea was indeed to start an OSMBE instance of it but I never had (or took) the time to move forward with it.
Sun, Apr 16, 2023, 18:18:53 - Jonathan: https://github.com/osmbe/community_planning/issues/40
Sun, Apr 16, 2023, 18:24:21 - Marc_marc: if you need help, tell me
Sun, Apr 16, 2023, 18:26:18 - Marc_marc: but with my "sysadmin osm-fr" cap, all of this seem very "still a draft"
Sun, Apr 16, 2023, 18:27:07 - Marc_marc: the disks for the osm-fr instance are to my knowledge only arrived
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 09:25:20 - joost_schouppe: I do think having such an instance would help us get further projects
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 10:31:18 - Jonathan: <@marc_marc:matrix.org "but with my "sysadmin osm-fr" ca..."> That's the feeling I had too.
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 11:53:33 - kvde: With regards to privacy I got the feedback from legal that there are no clear rules but only a more general rule that someone can expect privacy in his home. "home" must be interpreted as more than just the builiding. This also means you can expect privacy in your garden. off course the front garden isn't included in that. But taking pictures over a hedge in the back garden is not permitted. 
So the advice was to look at it on a case by case basis.
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 11:54:50 - kvde: With regards to NATO etc I would really stay away with a camera. I worked in the building next to the NATO construction site and they got phonecalls if someone was looking out of the window for to long.
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 12:02:19 - kvde: as stated above WVI got the feedback from their legal department to not take pictures above 2m heigt to avoid taking pictures over walls, hedges, ...
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 12:55:56 - St√©phane De Greef: So I'd better delete some of my old uploads from 2022.
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 13:09:53 - Marc_marc: or blur the NATO side if mapillary has not done so
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 14:01:38 - joost_schouppe: I would also ask Mapillary if they can't automate a thing like this
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 14:04:44 - St√©phane De Greef: <@marc_marc:matrix.org "or blur the NATO side if mapilla..."> They haven't. 
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 14:12:46 - Rapha√´l_PasLoin: NATO is not blured on AIV or Urbis imagery ; you can see charging station, parking for disable ; bicyle parking and all detail so i have a doubt is considered as sensitive or military by Belgian authority (same with a part of the shape).
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 14:13:47 - Rapha√´l_PasLoin: same on google
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 14:20:52 - Rapha√´l_PasLoin: Eversestraat is more sensitive and bluring entry, radar, sgrs building is a good precaution.
Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 14:22:39 - Rapha√´l_PasLoin: The best automatic think should be that mappilary ask shape file on IGN and blurr this automaticly ; they are the editor technicly not you ;-)

Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 18:34:46 - joost_schouppe: Yes, best to do this before upload. You could try again with the Mapillary helpdesk, but I think delete and re-upload is all they can suggest. I understand if you don't want to do the hassle. It might be useful to mention the wrong date in the folder name, so we can fix the offline copy at some point.

In Flanders, it is much more (geometrically) interesting to recover street lights from GRB (wpi), but an inventory of small poles (e.g. Amsterdammer) would sometimes be interesting to municipalities (because these are not present in GRB)

Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:26:01 - timcouwelier: So... someone reached out to me - given he noticed my mapillary imagery.
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:26:53 - timcouwelier: Someone flying a drone, and looking to go commercial with a company that does photogrammetry and orthofoto imagery.
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:27:51 - timcouwelier: asked about his setup:
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:27:53 - timcouwelier: Ik vlieg met een drone met RTK module, waarbij elke foto op 3 a 5cm gekende geolocatie staat, inclusief de oblieke hoek. Afhankelijk toepassing kan ik dan eigenlijk alles exporteren via software, kan een puntenwolk zijn, een 3d model in PDF een orthofoto, ... het belangrijkste is mijn vluchtplan goed instellen. Maar vooraleer ik live ga met mijn branding zou ik dus een case willen doen voor mezelf. Het liefst eentje waarmee ik een mooi staaltje van de resultaten kan tonen
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:28:42 - timcouwelier: Did counter that Mapillary is strictly 'street level' imagery. 
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:29:03 - timcouwelier: now thinking if there's a good use case I can think of for either OSM or work üôÇ
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:30:20 - timcouwelier: appears he also does them temperature-scan-images.
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:31:08 - timcouwelier: Imagine programming an entire flight plan through a city section to collect imagery through a drone. 
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 09:31:24 - timcouwelier: Like.. no bike helmets on the lower end of the image and such
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 10:23:45 - St√©phane De Greef: And plenty of obstacles in the way. üòÖ
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 10:24:34 - St√©phane De Greef: I can only see the legal and safety issues about flying a drone over roads are 2-3m high. 
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 10:48:15 - kvde: and privacy issues. 3m high means taking pictures over hedges, walls where people can expect privacy.
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 11:02:08 - St√©phane De Greef: Very true. 
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 11:02:55 - St√©phane De Greef: I can't imagine anyone getting the permits to do such a flight in a urban area over more than a very limited stretch of road.
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 15:00:24 - timcouwelier: I'll ask him about it
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 15:00:27 - timcouwelier: Drone is deze (M3T):

Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 15:00:35 - timcouwelier: (was the response he gave me about the setup)
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 15:02:50 - timcouwelier: That said, for private construction projects it might be a bit different then public roads. He might be targetting that niche more.
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 15:32:42 - Marc_marc: this would be practical, i had wanted to do it to map buildings under construction outside the cadastre. openarialmap hosts this kind of aerial view. of course there is a privacy issue but i don't see the problem apart from legal/theoretical, no one is going to look at their neighbour in a swimming costume on openaerialmap. so what could be seen from the sky that is an infringement of privacy in high resolution but not in lower resolution ?
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 20:33:28 - timcouwelier: Google said the drone by itself is just shy of 3k EUR though
Tue, Apr 25, 2023, 20:33:39 - timcouwelier: doubt the misses would let me get away with that
Wed, Apr 26, 2023, 09:12:34 - kvde: IANAL but yes for pictures from the sky the resolution/quality matters in terms of privacy. 
And I wouldn't be to sure about the statement that nobody is going to be looking at their neighbour suntanning on openaerialmap. 
I'm pretty sure our legal (iok) will stop us if we are sending drones in the sky where we also take pictures of peoples back yards.
Wed, Apr 26, 2023, 09:22:57 - stijn_claes: As a drone operator you have to have the permission to fly over the property, I think. I think they are subject to different legislation than operators who are executing aerial surveys using airplanes or helicopters
Wed, Apr 26, 2023, 12:44:26 - Marc_marc: yes, the law is like that, but i really wonder what concrete case of invasion of privacy justifies this. personally, flying a drone outside is mainly a nuisance due to the noise, in many towns and villages, the neighbour has a more intrusive view than a drone flying at 20m height

I've asked this question on the Mapillary forum but unfortunately no answer. Does anyone know whether the GoPro player could be used to visualize 360¬∞-images as a real 360¬∞ without distortion (so similar to Mapillary)? At IOK we consider to buy a GoPro Max but, when we would take imagery on private domain, we would not upload this on Mapillary, so we need another environment to visualize them.

Mon, Jun 5, 2023, 21:02:41 - joost_schouppe: Is it any use to you?
Mon, Jun 5, 2023, 21:12:43 - stijn_claes: Should indeed be in the box @ dentonny
Mon, Jun 5, 2023, 21:53:12 - dentonny: I don't think so.. 
Mon, Jun 5, 2023, 21:53:33 - dentonny: So where do we meet? :D
Tue, Jun 6, 2023, 08:48:05 - joost_schouppe: I'll send you a pm
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:26:17 - eMerzh: Some of you might have seen the demo of panoramax https://peertube.fr/w/pyF1dyUioksHvSqDxc4ZJ4 :) 
i find it really interesting... and the images looks a lot crisper than on mapillary... 

wonder if some of our authorities would be interested.... especially knowing that's it's partly backed by IGN in france... 


Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:26:49 - eMerzh: for example wallonia with the GEO challenge pierreserpe ü§î
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:30:12 - Thibaultmol: it's kind of a shame that so much of their dev and communications happen only in French. 
I wonder if they did more stuff in English, it might attract more users/developers
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:32:24 - eMerzh: agree :|  ... but you know... üá´üá∑ ü•ñ 
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:33:44 - Thibaultmol: yeah xd
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:34:01 - Thibaultmol: Hopefully they can do an English talk at SOTM europe
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:34:12 - eMerzh: as TLDR...  they launched a "startup" baked by IGN (~NGI) that supports the dev... 

they have 2 instances... osm-fr & IGN

blurring API is working pretty good they have a POC for traffic sign detections
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:36:10 - eMerzh: for now the front is pretty basic but it might extends... 
and they are working now to embark some official communities like cities, regions... 

ofc havin IGN behin is a big plus, and they already have demands ... so it's pretty good news... although it's early in the process
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:37:24 - eMerzh: yes hopefully they can switch in english once they have a bit more traction
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:37:30 - Marc_marc: Thibaultmol: I find it quite strange when 2 people who are natives of the same language speak English, but I understand that this poses a problem if they want to open up the team... having said that, I don't know if this is the real aim, as even in the osm-fr sysadmins the information isn't really passed on.
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:38:09 - Thibaultmol: <@emerzh:matrix.org "as TLDR...  they launched a "sta..."> nice, thx!

Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:39:48 - Thibaultmol: But yeah, i can imagine pretty much most talks at osm fr are in french. But yeah, just makes it harder for foreigners to feel interested I guess
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:42:34 - Marc_marc: hoping than one day, all european 'll be esperanto native üôÇ
Mon, Jun 19, 2023, 20:45:41 - eMerzh: ;-) well i'm not as far as you go Thibaultmol  with the english, but yeah , if you do something to be shared on the internet , maybe it's better to do it in english [directly]

Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 13:21:38 - Seppe: A colleague made a Mapillary setup with a laptop bag. Inside is a plate the size of a laptop with a telescopic broom stick attached to it. It comes out the top through a small hole that was cut in the fabric of the bag
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 13:21:58 - Thibaultmol: nice!
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 13:22:00 - Seppe: This is the maximal length of the stick
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 13:22:21 - Seppe: With the minimal length, it just sticks out of the bag
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 13:23:30 - Seppe: The attachment of the camera to the stick is a bit more work than with the standard GoPro gear, but not at all a problem.
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 13:24:15 - Seppe: These are the first test images: https://www.mapillary.com/app/?pKey=643297067841647 (I should have worn a hat :-) )
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 13:24:34 - Seppe: Good enough in my opinion
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 13:24:47 - Seppe: And very easy to walk around with
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 14:08:20 - stijn_claes: Do you have somewhere a description of the used equipment?
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 14:14:37 - kvde: and a lot of pictures?
Tue, Jun 27, 2023, 17:14:03 - joost_schouppe: <@Seppe:matrix.org "These are the first test images:..."> Without the hat, we can check your progress if you use the same setup for a few years

Fri, Jun 30, 2023, 17:06:04 - dentonny: does someone know the logic behind the automatic folder creation on the GoPro ?
Fri, Jun 30, 2023, 17:06:36 - joost_schouppe: New folder every 500 or 1000 images,  and sometimes randomly after a few images
Fri, Jun 30, 2023, 17:07:49 - dentonny: 'logic'
Fri, Jun 30, 2023, 17:09:34 - dentonny: I thought it was based on date at first. So I was like hey wtf where are my images? First half from today in the folder from yesterday apparently 
Fri, Jun 30, 2023, 17:33:36 - joost_schouppe: Indeed, no effect from time
Sun, Jul 2, 2023, 14:14:01 - dentonny: Ok note to self... Blijft van die camera af eens em gestart is
Sun, Jul 2, 2023, 14:15:43 - dentonny: Ik dacht ik ga mij werk besparen door de opname te stoppen en opnieuw te starten waar nodig is. Anders veel werk om de slechte foto's te wissen.
Nu ben ik onderweg ofwel de tel kwijt geweest, ofwel niet hard genoeg gedrukt...

Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 09:02:23 - kvde: does that mean we can expect new images on mapillary soon?
Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 09:29:03 - dentonny: They already are online :)
Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 09:58:31 - kvde: not visible yet for me. üò¢

Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 11:07:35 - dentonny: Though not as much images taken as I wanted to :/ 
Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 11:09:23 - joost_schouppe: it's even more frustrating when your SD card crashes and all is lost
Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 11:09:56 - joost_schouppe: (I format the SD after copying -not moving!- all the images to a safe place)
Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 15:07:00 - dentonny: https://www.mapillary.com/app/?pKey=305007641953117
forgot to delete those.. xcuseme :D
Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 15:23:24 - kvde: you can delete images in mapillary. So you can still clean up the sequence.
Mon, Jul 3, 2023, 18:44:20 - Marc_marc: I thought that the licence was irrevocable and that mapillarry kept the photo by simply disconnecting the photo from your profile/sequence
Tue, Jul 4, 2023, 07:38:57 - Thibaultmol: iirc you can ask them to delete an image and they'll comply.

But because they have CC BY SA, anyone who has a copy, can continue using that copy 
Tue, Jul 4, 2023, 08:12:40 - kvde: In this case that isn't an issue. and removing the photo from the sequence is what you want to do.

Wed, Jul 5, 2023, 17:44:00 - Thibaultmol: <@dentonny:matrix.org "green vs blue = ?"> Blue is whatever you have selected ((user or organisation).
Green is just 'the rest' of images on mapillary
Wed, Jul 5, 2023, 17:56:20 - joost_schouppe: Indeed, osmbe org vs others
Wed, Jul 5, 2023, 22:16:52 - timcouwelier: oo who's doing Roeselare?

Wed, Jul 5, 2023, 22:17:40 - timcouwelier: nice nonetheless
Wed, Jul 5, 2023, 22:18:13 - timcouwelier: Any chance there's a spare camera over the summer holidays (july 21st till mid august?)
Wed, Jul 5, 2023, 22:20:48 - joost_schouppe: That should be doable
Wed, Jul 5, 2023, 22:20:59 - joost_schouppe: Let me come back to you!
Wed, Jul 5, 2023, 22:31:10 - joost_schouppe: I promised a camera to someone near here, starting this week. I'll ask him if mid August is fine for him as well. I think it's likely. So I can probably send the cam to you. IIRC you'll probably use the car, right?

Tue, Jul 18, 2023, 18:20:13 - Thibaultmol: although I guess it would only have to be sidewalk. . but yeah...

Hope Fiberklaar comes to Ruiselede at some point
Tue, Jul 18, 2023, 18:22:06 - joost_schouppe: careful what you wish for :)
here they really made a mess of things, I guess with all the onderaannemers and onder-onderaannemers etc

Tue, Jul 18, 2023, 18:22:49 - Thibaultmol: yeah... and the dream of EDPnet at some point being a fiber installer is also gone now that they got bought out by proximus because they were unprofitable

Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:47:20 - timcouwelier: planning to put it to good use over the next few weeks.
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:47:48 - timcouwelier: So ideally I upload to mapillary but keep a copy to send to Thibaultmol?
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:48:25 - joost_schouppe: exactly!
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:49:03 - timcouwelier: okay, hopefully i don't run out of storage capacity then, not checked the size per image yet üôÇ
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:49:25 - Thibaultmol: Either by mailing me the sd card (tape it to a small cardboard sheet and let me know exactly how many cards you send) or sending via internet pigeon (syncing)
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:50:32 - timcouwelier: Als je meer dan 750GB verbruikt tijdens de piekuren, blijf je onbeperkt surfen, maar wel trager tijdens de piekuren tot je volgende aanrekeningsperiode.
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:51:02 - timcouwelier: at 127 GB used in 8 days - someone's been netflixing a bit much lol
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:51:37 - joost_schouppe: <@timcouwelier:matrix.org "okay, hopefully i don't run out ..."> you need about 5 gig per hour of shooting
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:51:40 - timcouwelier: oh only 41gb was in peak hours, I'm good lol
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:52:42 - timcouwelier: dang, may was 585GB of internet usage. Glad we're not in a 20gb/month max era anymore
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:53:47 - dentonny: The subscription of my dad was once suspended when I lived there :)

Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:54:04 - dentonny: I think it was even 10gig/month
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:54:08 - timcouwelier: Thibaultmol: feel free to let me know where that internet pigeon resides. Just in case.
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:56:38 - dentonny: <@timcouwelier:matrix.org "Als je meer dan 750GB verbruikt ..."> Isn't it 3TB today?
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:57:31 - timcouwelier: That's what mine says üòß
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 15:57:43 - timcouwelier: Telenet. But that's peak hour load, not total.
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 16:01:11 - dentonny: I have One and it's 3TB. And 300gig on mobile lol
Thu, Jul 20, 2023, 16:08:34 - timcouwelier: Ah, we have one of them Whoppa bundles I think.

Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 09:34:02 - timcouwelier: and yeah - a bulkload of dead ends around here
Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 09:34:40 - timcouwelier: stijn_claes: will focus on my own neighbourhood + where i have projects for work and the imagery will help me there
Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 09:34:55 - timcouwelier: both for 'recent before' and 'after' photography

Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 12:32:23 - St√©phane De Greef: Yeah, that's why I'm usually planning with Komoot for one neighbourhood, then going to a different place for a few days until my recent images are uploaded on Mapillary.
Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 12:32:49 - St√©phane De Greef: I use mapillary with OSM background + komoot with OSM background side by side

Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 21:47:12 - dentonny: Planning is easy when you live in the USA with all their square blocks and straight roads.
In Belgium (probably whole Europe) though.... Pff
Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 22:59:51 - timcouwelier: i was not ready for the looks people give you

Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 23:00:11 - timcouwelier: some even took the time to strike a pose.
Tue, Jul 25, 2023, 23:22:37 - Thibaultmol: Yeah same. I was in Antwerp at some point. And even there i got a lot of nice smiles and waves
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 00:56:49 - dentonny: I still have more than 1TB available on my Google Drive. Can it be to any use for someone/something here?
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 07:11:29 - joost_schouppe: <@dentonny:matrix.org "I still have more than 1TB avail..."> Does Thibault already have it?
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 09:50:03 - Thibaultmol: if you DM me the link, then I can download it to the osmbe archive
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:15:03 - dentonny: How do you sort the folders? Because when I formated the card recently, the folder naming began again with 100GOPRO. So now I have more folders with the same name.
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:17:04 - joost_schouppe: I use a system (and Thibault quite likes it) with something like "20230301 place or ride"
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:17:42 - joost_schouppe: so they are always chronoligcally sorted, and you can easily find a specific ride back again
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:17:51 - dentonny: aha great
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:17:54 - joost_schouppe: and you don't need to care about the folder names the gopro creates
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:19:48 - dentonny: stijn_claes: there were still images on it from you. What should I do with them?
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:25:33 - joost_schouppe: Updated [the instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mu27MJlwgXL0vBnF3Nfn2my8AIU-dOYl/edit) with this convention
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:30:36 - dentonny: and also the non-360 imagery I made when hiking?
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:31:06 - dentonny: maybe in a different folder? Just to keep it clean :D
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:32:11 - joost_schouppe: indeed. I suggested a folder per device, but if you make both 360 and 180 with the same device, it makes sense to keep them in a different folder!
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 10:32:33 - dentonny: roger that
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 11:00:06 - joost_schouppe: I made two measily trips to Spain, and now I'm top 7 all time contributor there. I finally uploaded the last 60000 images, so I might end up number 6 :D
(all GoPro Hero images though; the 360 does not work well with the camper)
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 11:00:52 - joost_schouppe: hmmm, I'm also number 8 in France
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 13:59:38 - stijn_claes: On the small SD-card on the cardboard in the envelope, you mean? That's the copy of the original images which should be sent to Thibault for the back-up (Koen and I did not use a Google Drive to transfer them to Thibault but we asked Joost to provide us with an SD-card on which we copied our original images).

If there were still some images from me on the SD-card in the GoPro itself, they normally were already copied to the other SD-card, so you can remove them (but I thought I formatted the SD-card in the GoPro, if I remember well)
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 14:01:27 - joost_schouppe: Right, so if thet SD card is almost full, send it by letter to Thibault.
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 14:09:00 - dentonny: <@stijn_claes:matrix.org "On the small SD-card on the card..."> Yes there will still images on the card that was in the camera. I have them on my PC now.
 I didn't even touch the card in the envelope yet
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 14:20:55 - Thibaultmol: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Right, so if thet SD card is alm..."> or google drive or sync them to me. Whatever your network provider allows xd
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 16:24:03 - dentonny: What about bike rides which cross different municipalities? Separate folder per municipality? :)

Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 16:29:24 - Thibaultmol: I personally wouldn't btoher
Wed, Jul 26, 2023, 16:29:55 - Thibaultmol: I usually would call it "2023 07 26 Ruiselede to Roeselare DWVL" (dwvl in this case just being acronym for where i went to roeselare for)

Sat, Jul 29, 2023, 21:34:15 - Thibaultmol: i really hope that Geovisio can make a proper 'snap-to-road' or some kind offset tool 
Sat, Jul 29, 2023, 22:53:52 - stijn_claes: When the offset was quite large, I did that in Geosetter, but not everywhere...

Sat, Jul 29, 2023, 23:37:44 - Thibaultmol: <@marc_marc:matrix.org "on witch media ? hdd ?"> A proper NAS server I have. 2 of the 8 drives can fail. Only if a 3rd drive falls, then there would be data loss. So yeah.. Should be pretty good
Sat, Jul 29, 2023, 23:39:33 - joost_schouppe: <@thibaultmol:matrix.org "i really hope that Geovisio can ..."> Kartaview does this by default IIRC. The downside is that it can fail to detect the road you're on correctly, especially if your road happens to not be mapped in osm yet
Sat, Jul 29, 2023, 23:39:55 - Thibaultmol: Fair
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 19:04:01 - joost_schouppe invited Raf
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 19:07:28 - Raf joined the room
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 20:45:22 - Raf: Thanks for inviting me.

First question:
I'd like to browse through the 360 pictures before uploading.
With the GoPro Player I can only see one picture at a time
or I don't find the function to browse.
Just usefull to cut off my fingers at start and stop...

Any suggestion for another program?
Thanks.
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 20:49:22 - Thibaultmol: Honestly. I just use a regular image viewer. it's not 360. but.. yeah.. just go scan the image with your eyes from left to right
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 20:49:51 - Thibaultmol: some things will be small, and you might not see them. but yeah. there is no real 360 image viewer that easily allows you to go through many of them
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 20:50:27 - joost_schouppe: Same here. I go through them real quick with irfanview
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 20:51:09 - joost_schouppe: With the "flat" images I just use the large preview in Windows Explorer
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 20:51:24 - Thibaultmol: Yeah, irfanview on windows. Gwenview on linux.
Both just excellent image viewers

It's still not 100% working (no  maptiles in Belgium when running the docker API) but it is possible to upload your pictures in command line (see CLI in the documentation) and visualize it here: https://pierreserpe.synology.me:5015
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:11:00 - Marc_marc: yes I'am (but it seems I m iss the 1st part)
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:11:35 - joost_schouppe: Do you envision a 360 everywhere instance or can we do this together?
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:13:24 - Marc_marc: me orr pierre ?
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:15:19 - pierreserpe: We can do this together of course. I have 10tb only but can look for 20tb instead. Also, i have no GPU on the nas which make the blurring of faces and car plates more complicated 
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:19:10 - pierreserpe: Adrien is happy to accelerate the compatibility with osm id editor with the help of contributors
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:27:10 - joost_schouppe: This is some initial pointers from @Jonathan, who manages our infrastructure:
* All our other stuff is at Digital Ocean. Ideally we put it there as well, but if you could research that a bit (to see if there's much better solutions), that'd be great
* if Digital Ocean is OK, we can set you up a VM there
* we do not have physical servers and would prefer not to go there
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:27:32 - joost_schouppe: Where is your machine at, Pierre? 
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:27:51 - Thibaultmol: just at his house, seeing as it's a synology ddns
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:27:55 - Thibaultmol: (I assume)
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:27:55 - joost_schouppe: And 
Marc_marc, of course I'd be happy with your help too!
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:28:36 - joost_schouppe: Maybe it makes sense to create a room specifically for this project?
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:28:44 - Thibaultmol: (keep in mind that cloud storage is expensive. def Digital Ocean's own storage buckets. It might be best to use an S3 compatible storage system like backblaze or Wasabi. With something like Cloudflare infront so that it can be cached)
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:29:30 - joost_schouppe: An estimate of costs in one or a few different setups would be useful!
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:30:03 - joost_schouppe: And if there's no alternative, having an actual server may be an option (but really a last resort)
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:31:11 - Marc_marc: I think there are very different stages: 1) install (it's done) and run the instance with everything you need: a very small CT/VM is enough 2) host large volumes of photos... obviously the cost is important... and maybe the front-end will access images located elsewhere 
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 21:40:08 - Thibaultmol: For anyone that wants to join in on the discussion regarding that. We have now created an invite-only room for that
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 22:02:00 - stijn_claes: Is there an option in Irfanview to remove the 360¬∞ distortion or is it similar to the previews in standard image program of Windows as well as Geosetter?
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 22:03:39 - Thibaultmol: nope. haven't found any that can do it AND still make it easy to swiitch from previous to next image
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 22:04:59 - stijn_claes: and ideally combine it with a map viewer
Thu, Aug 3, 2023, 23:41:41 - dentonny: I just tried the Insta360 Player and it works. Downside is you can't use the arrow keys on the keyboard for moving to the next or previous image as it's used for moving the image around. But there are buttons onscreen to quickly click on them for browsing to the next

Fri, Aug 4, 2023, 00:36:45 - St√©phane De Greef: There's no horizontal auto-level. And the GPS is totally off, only recording one location every 30 seconds or so.
Fri, Aug 4, 2023, 00:36:51 - St√©phane De Greef: It's total BS.
Fri, Aug 4, 2023, 00:39:07 - St√©phane De Greef: Only added value is a higher frame rate. That's it.
Fri, Aug 4, 2023, 08:32:39 - Rapha√´l_PasLoin: If you extract gps data from your .360 with https://goprotelemetryextractor.com/free/ you see also gap or not ? First time i use .360 i haved the same issue ; after checking time on the camera i have a 1 minutes difference on official time and it's look like this fix this kind of behaviour (large error of position) when in video mode.
Fri, Aug 4, 2023, 08:46:15 - kvde: <@stefdegreef:matrix.org "Only added value is a higher fra..."> the biggest added value should be that the automatic feature detection from mapillary performs better. I was looking at videos to detect traffic signs but I ran into some issues that I couldn't solve.

Fri, Aug 4, 2023, 09:59:11 - dentonny: <@stefdegreef:matrix.org "There's no horizontal auto-level..."> horizontal auto-level only works in 'Hero' mode I think

15 images with holes and circles
Ideal for bird observation:

Then normal again:

A few hundred meters its starts again:

7 missing and then back again:

Just a bug or something to worry about?

- is there any plan on becoming available on #Fdroid ? 
- does it just create an overlay on existing OSM data or is it either directly integrated into the data set or come with the option to export the data ? 
- how does it deal with conflicting OSM data ? 
- are there options to connect to existing image sharing sites like #mapillary or #KartaView ? 
- under what license do my uploaded photos fall ?
Sat, Aug 12, 2023, 09:43:21 - Thibaultmol: I got dm'd by the ceo of mapilio last year. And i was basically "implement a way to import images from Mapilarry. BUT also have it so that you can easily link images from Mapilarry to mapilio."

Because imagine if you have both layers enabled in an editor like ID or josm. Some images might only be available on my Mapilarry and some might only be available on mapilio and then there will be a bunch of images that are on both services... that sounds like a mess. So if you could somehow link them so the editors know if they're the same. That'd be ideal
Sat, Aug 12, 2023, 09:46:46 - Thibaultmol: Same with geovisio ngl.
Like... there needs to be a way. Maybe using hash or something.
To make it clear to editors that two images on two or more services are just the same so it only display it once
Sat, Aug 12, 2023, 10:49:15 - joost_schouppe: Isn't that a lot like having several osm renders available within the editor ? Sure, activating all of them at the same time would be a mess, but they all are a little different and shown separately. I agree it's annoying to have to look at several image providers at the same time, but it seems unfair to push it on mapilio to solve that. For example a plugin that filters the best images (by recency, resolution, 360) from any image source could also fix this.
Sat, Aug 12, 2023, 10:51:48 - joost_schouppe: It would be really great if there's an import/export from mapillary/kartaview. But again, let's first have a look with a small batch to see if it is worth more effort
Sat, Aug 12, 2023, 13:25:28 - Thibaultmol: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Isn't that a lot like having sev..."> I don't fully agree.
with regular image layers. you have imagery everywhere. quality might different in different places. but atleast there is FULL coverage.

With streetview layers, you can't garantee it has full coverage. So most people won't bother going through every single streetview imagery provider to see if there is imagery available

Sun, Aug 27, 2023, 11:24:18 - Raf: A few times I have one or 2 pictures without GPS.
Yesterday I had almost 900 pictures without exif.
A whole range over several sessions that lasted for 45min. 
Then everything normal again.
In the meantime, the GPS on my router recorded correctly my route.
Bug or other problem?
Can one unintentionally cut off the gps of the gopro?

Ps. I can‚Äôt find back de manual of Joost.

I found the switch some levels lower.
I‚Äôll now check regularly if it‚Äôs still on.
I never checked the gps droplet before.

It‚Äôs no problem to do the missing links again, also my route and recording do not always match.

Tue, Sep 12, 2023, 16:11:20 - St√©phane De Greef: That's actually one of the questions I was asked in Amsterdam maptime: is there an automated way to define the perfect itinerary to streetview a defined area.
Tue, Sep 12, 2023, 16:13:03 - St√©phane De Greef: I had no answer except to tell them any automated way would depend on possible incorrect map data ^_^
Tue, Sep 12, 2023, 16:13:23 - Thibaultmol: St√©phane De Greef how do you actually determine your routes?
Do you try to do blocks or try to do a bunch of straight lines and then fill in the blanks.

Cause I feel like would be looking down on my phone so often to get the exact route that it would mess with the capture
Tue, Sep 12, 2023, 16:38:46 - St√©phane De Greef: I actually talked about this during my talk. Initially I was going for a neighbourhood approach: taking every turn at every street, to ensure I don't forget anything in a very small area. But then I realised I was passing many times in the same streets, again and again, wasting time and energy, so I changed to a long-game aproach, going from one end of a street all the way to the end, in a E-W-E-W pattern, then doing the N-S-N-S another time. Pros: less turns, easier to follow directions, better GPS accuracy, and easier to watch a sequence on Mapillary. Cons: you need to better plan and come back only after a few days to ensure you didn't miss any side street.
Tue, Sep 12, 2023, 16:40:49 - St√©phane De Greef: So this is how I started Amsterdam:

I disagree with the fact that people can just decide to keep it (whatever the reason).
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 10:09:13 - joost_schouppe: well I do "force" rotation after some time, depending on what was agreed before and whether they are putting it to good use
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 10:34:59 - timcouwelier: Jonathan: I've only received the one I have now under a week ago, hence me not jumping at the chance to send it out straight away. But beyond that, fully agree that if called upon I should send it wherever.
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 10:43:40 - Jonathan: timcouwelier No worries of course :)
It was generally speaking.
And as I said, I'm really up for buying a new one so we can do more rotations.
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 10:51:12 - dentonny: I've said it a couple of times before that I don't mind sending to someone else. Just say the word.
Only the last time I didn't respond I think but that wasn't on purpose though..
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 10:52:06 - dentonny: ehm oops, busted?

Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 11:05:59 - dentonny: Geel ain't finished if that is what you mean but that doesn't mean I don't want to send the camera. I can finish it another time
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 11:06:30 - dentonny: it's only the weekends I can go out
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 11:15:17 - Thibaultmol: (I usually don't really care when it'd get the cam cause i'm not really on a schedule.. except that one weekend I'll be in Antwerp in oct, I'd like to use it cause i'll have nothing else to do there xd)
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 11:16:10 - joost_schouppe: OK, then I guess you two should coordinate
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 11:18:14 - Jonathan: Let's still buy a 4th GoPro and send it to dentonny üëç
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 11:20:49 - dentonny: if it's okay with Thibaultmol I will send the cam after this weekend because I have no plans and the weather looks great (for the moment) ?
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 11:20:50 - joost_schouppe: he has one now, wouldn't it make more sense to send one to Thibault?

In reply to @joost_schouppe:matrix.org
he has one now, wouldn't it make more sense to send one to Thibault?

Mine can be used to. W'll discuss it live in the afternoon.
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 12:08:23 - St√©phane De Greef: I'd remove that one before he sues you üòÇ 
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 12:47:56 - kvde: maybe it is a good idea to remove it. Not because we might get sued but because it is the correct thing to do. And this makes it more difficult for goverment agencies to say that this doesn't invade privacy.
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 12:48:13 - kvde: so it might make my life more difficult. :)
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 13:15:42 - Thibaultmol: yeah, already reported to mapillary
Tue, Sep 26, 2023, 13:30:34 - dentonny: work just called. Due to technical problems I must stay home... :D

Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 08:38:10 - timcouwelier: I did notice it escaping my roof and it fell towards side of the road so didn‚Äôt get run over 
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 08:38:19 - timcouwelier: Or damage other vehicles 
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 08:40:04 - timcouwelier: Yet to check my roof actually 
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 08:40:40 - joost_schouppe: Hmm. So triple suction cups next time? Did you check how clean your roof was? Did you give the mount a yank to test before leaving?
The first time I used the set-up, I used a little rope as an insurance. I guess we should do that always then
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 08:41:18 - timcouwelier: Yes and yes - but no cable tether

Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 08:42:11 - joost_schouppe: Yeah, that's what they do, them bastards 
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 08:45:51 - Thibaultmol: <@timcouwelier:matrix.org "Lenses seem fine"> that's a miracle considering they stick out, damn 
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 09:13:45 - timcouwelier: think it's the shock of the fall that caused the screen break, not the impact on it.
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 09:14:06 - timcouwelier: with roof tilted back slightly, camera was titled slightly forward on the mount
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 09:14:14 - timcouwelier: might have saved the lenses
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 09:14:59 - timcouwelier: not sure what options on screen repair are. at present the screen is mostly used if you need to put the camera in pairing mode I think, most controls happen from the phone.
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 09:44:50 - kvde: you can buy a replacement screen on aliexpress and diy? 
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 09:51:41 - joost_schouppe: St√©phane De Greef had some repairs done by GoPro itself. Probably the most simple solution.
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 09:56:33 - timcouwelier: <@kvde:matrix.org "you can buy a replacement screen..."> can't say I feel confident doing that myself tbh
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 10:00:01 - Thibaultmol: I have done smartphone repairs but I have a feeling that gopro's are much more difficult to repair somehow
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 10:04:53 - kvde: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FpqJ86i7Mk4
This makes me think I could do it myself. No soldering needed just clip the connectors loose.
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 10:05:59 - kvde: But I'm not giving any guarantees. but a phone repair shop should be able to handle this.
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 10:07:50 - joost_schouppe: can the parts be bought somewhere?
Wed, Sep 27, 2023, 10:12:05 - kvde: for these kind of things aliexpress is my first search

Thu, Sep 28, 2023, 10:10:09 - St√©phane De Greef: I've done it, it took a few weeks but they sent me a new camera, not fixing bits, just replacing everything.
Thu, Sep 28, 2023, 10:11:47 - St√©phane De Greef: Thing is, there might be hidden damage. Maybe the GPS or sensor or card interface are damaged and you won't know. I'd replace the whole thing if you're a subscriber.

Fri, Sep 29, 2023, 02:31:57 - Thibaultmol: It should detect duplicates, yeah

Fri, Sep 29, 2023, 09:04:08 - joost_schouppe: St√©phane De Greef: unfortunately, we don't have GoPro subscriptions for all the cameras
kvde : considering possible hidden damage, do you still think its worth trying to fix it?
timcouwelier : have you tried the camera already after the fall? Does it appear to work?
Thibaultmol : do you want to order a camera yourself (I'll pay ya back), or would you like me to do it?
Fri, Sep 29, 2023, 09:24:43 - Thibaultmol: Guess it makes sense to keep the orders centralized? So maybe it's best if you do it (then the sub (if you want to get it) can also be done via your account?)
Fri, Sep 29, 2023, 09:27:05 - joost_schouppe: I'll try to order this weekend. I'll look into how accounts work if you have more than one device

Sun, Oct 1, 2023, 16:56:48 - joost_schouppe: maybe you can post that on the gopro or mapillary forum for advice?
Sun, Oct 1, 2023, 16:57:05 - joost_schouppe: might be an issue with the battery (try the other one)

Sun, Oct 1, 2023, 17:00:52 - dentonny: It happened after changing the battery. 
Sound effects were ok , that's why I didn't notice. Even the 3 times beep when I wanted to stop a recording because I was doing a stretch that I already did.
Sun, Oct 1, 2023, 17:02:02 - dentonny: It was because I wanted to scratch my head , that I took off the helmet and noticed :)

Mon, Oct 2, 2023, 09:41:16 - joost_schouppe: Nevermind! It doesn't work with a space in the code.
Mon, Oct 2, 2023, 10:37:01 - kvde: I think repairing it is worth a shot. I would try and buy the second hand parts one. We will probably break another one if we keep up the amount of kms we are doing now.
Mon, Oct 2, 2023, 11:15:57 - joost_schouppe: Indeed. Now I have bought a subscription and we can replace two cameras per year for 100 euro each. Probably a good deal for a 25/50euro subscription.
Mon, Oct 2, 2023, 11:16:17 - joost_schouppe: They don't really say the device needs to break *after* registering it in the account
Mon, Oct 2, 2023, 11:16:28 - joost_schouppe: So I guess... we could try sending it in
Mon, Oct 2, 2023, 11:16:50 - joost_schouppe: But if you think there's a decent chance of repairing it, that might be more ethical I guess
Mon, Oct 2, 2023, 14:13:25 - kvde: If you bought the subscription I would send it in. repairing it ourselfs has nog guarantees. 
there is a pretty decent chance we invest in a second sreen and still end up with a broken gopro.

Who is "We" here? What are the biggest hurdles? time? money? IT-knowledge?
Fri, Oct 6, 2023, 15:13:38 - joost_schouppe: We had a discussion about that in this room, but because it became too big, we set up a different room for that project. I can invite you there?
Fri, Oct 6, 2023, 15:14:15 - joost_schouppe: The people there are the "we". And the biggest hurdles are "deciding where to start" and "doing the actual work"
Fri, Oct 6, 2023, 15:14:27 - Thibaultmol: Has anyone actually used the protective lenses for the Max camera?
Fri, Oct 6, 2023, 15:15:17 - joost_schouppe: Yes, both me and... uhm, some others, maybe St√©phane... tried them. And neither of us was convinced by the resulting imagery
Fri, Oct 6, 2023, 15:19:02 - Thibaultmol: I kind of assumed that would be the problem. I wonder if it would have been possible for GoPro to just design a lens that can be easily swapped in case it breaks. (Not a cover but the actual lens). I guess not cos it's probably hard to make it waterproof than or something who knows
Fri, Oct 6, 2023, 15:19:12 - Thibaultmol: Invited you to the chat

Fri, Oct 6, 2023, 15:19:51 - Thibaultmol: Tldr: nothing has really happened, I've made a cost estimate for the "we're uploading all the existing images to this server" scenario.

I lurk Mapillary fora, but it's very tedious.

Thu, Oct 12, 2023, 20:45:26 - joost_schouppe: Re the "goals" hans.vandenabeele: some of it is explained here https://openstreetmap.be/nl/projects/streetlevelimagery.html
With this project, just having a Google Street view alternative that's actually open data is a goal in itself. For most of us here, the use for osm is obviously important. In practice, most of that is just "I'm mapping something somewhere, and I want to look at the images to help digitize stuff". So 360 is excellent, even in lower resolution, because you get an idea of the area very quickly. The higher the resolution, the better of course, because them you can read housenumbers, details of traffic signs, shop names etc.
The AI part currently happens purely on Mapillary end, and it generates useful data. For example georeferenced stuff like benches, road lay out, traffic signs,...
If we could do the ai part on our end, that'd be awesome. I see that as an extension of the GeoVisio program though. Also note that we already have more data than our mappers can process, so generating a million benches doesn't really help all that much. The challenge is finding the smallest number of detections with the biggest impact. Or creating flows that can help you work real fast

Thu, Oct 12, 2023, 21:12:19 - Thibaultmol: * one massive advantage would indeed be able to do our own object detections. While mapillary has many... But is also missing many. And some that are in there (like fire hydrants) are based on US fire hydrants... Which are different from other countries like Belgium. And honestly they have 0 reason to improve things like that.

Mapillary (meta's) main goal right now is collecting imagery so that when their ar glasses launch in the current decade some time, can recognize things irl and match it with Mapillary imagery.
And currently I've noticed that meta's RapID team seems to be focusing on mapping sidewalks again, to improve AR glasses stuff presumably.

Most other things are side things.

(Some of this is speculation, some is just observation)
Thu, Oct 12, 2023, 21:13:31 - Thibaultmol: Yeah, it's ok. But def with lower sun, i wish it could keep the lens on the other side of the camera to be the same brightness levels as the main side

Fri, Oct 13, 2023, 18:34:44 - hans.vandenabeele: Thanks Joost! I consider these camera+GPS data as something for "edge computing". As I understand OSM/Mapillary/... currently, that's to centralise everything. I've been filling TB disks since years, to the extend my (pocket)money for storage and computing power (own servers) ran out. Since, I scale down photos/videos and use dockers to split the types of processing to be able to scale up on (older) desktops that hang around here (cutting all overhead like virus scans, using just minimal ubuntu etc) to extract the real information from all data that photos/videos are. After extraction, say augmenting the footage (like PDF "scan img" + OCR text overlay), then I replace the original files (overwrite) with the enriched version. Depending on the application, it could mean a much smaller MP4 (lower resolution at least, typically downsampled 1:2 or 1:3 so that the files become 4-9 times smaller) with a .srt/vtt/... file joining the file. Offloading such processing allows parallel processing and could reduce the current delays sequences face. Does this trigger bells?
Fri, Oct 13, 2023, 19:06:11 - joost_schouppe: Well, it sounds potentially interesting indeed. Note that we don't have the ambition right now to replace Mapillary worldwide, but just offer an alternative for Belgium. Then the amount of data is relatively negligible compared to what you have. I think it would be interesting if you tried to install GeoVisio locally (Pierre Serpe did that already as well and the builders of the tool are willing to help),  as well as working with the French to explore the AI part that could be done on tip if it. In the end, it's just the derived data that needs to be online.

Mon, Oct 16, 2023, 19:14:32 - Thibaultmol: > It won't happen I'm afraid, as it would mean reprocessing all images. 

Well no.. not really... they wouldn't change the images. that would indeed be insane.

What they'll do is just determine the correct angle, add it as metadata to the image. And so any viewer will use that modifier to display the 360 sphere at an angle
Mon, Oct 16, 2023, 19:18:04 - Thibaultmol: As GITNE mentions on the forums:
> GPano:PosePitchDegrees and GPano:PoseRollDegrees 

Are two existing EXIF metadata tags that could be added to images to contian that data (obv, mapillary is storing image data in a database, not in individual jpg's exif data. But I just mean: it's doable for them to just add it as metadata. You wouldn't want to edit the images. Both because of resource demand and also just quality loss)
Mon, Oct 16, 2023, 19:22:04 - Thibaultmol: keep in mind: a 360 image is just stored as a 2d image. So resolution is high in the center but low in the poles. If you rotate that, you're moving high res regions to low res regions and the opposite. So it's much worse than rotating a 2d image

> As you move towards the poles of the 360-degree image, the resolution decreases because the same number of pixels now represents a smaller area of the scene. When rotating a 360-degree image, the interpolation process has to deal not only with the typical challenges of rotating a standard image but also with the varying resolution across different parts of the 360-degree image. This can lead to more pronounced quality degradation, especially in the areas where the resolution is initially lower.

I fully agree with the worries, risk of degradation, ... So far, I worked only with 2D footage, not 360 (that's a reason why I look for a GO PRO Max;-)) where rotation and quality loss are not too big an issue. Tests on object detection (traffic signs, ...) in the past did not give us worries (light, size/position, ... were). A project on VR got this in the documentation: https://dusan-pacal.medium.com/how-i-managed-to-resize-an-image-and-keep-all-the-exif-and-xmp-metadata-using-python-fa68172ee479 for 360 footage, I wonder how/which algorithms deal with a horizontal road surface (say left side (half of 2D image) of the camera) and a slope (right side) next to it;-) like in hills or mountains...
Tue, Oct 17, 2023, 11:34:57 - Thibaultmol: rotation does matter on a gopro max though... if you're using timelapse mode (which gives you the best quality) then there it won't auto level the horizon, so you will get tilted images if you're tilting the camera by accident.

Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:08:10 - Seppe: 1) "federated" in my mind means that there can be many different instances, but they can be viewed as one. Correct?
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:09:50 - Seppe: 2. What would happen if we would just throw all our imagery on the French instance? Would that be possible? How do you restrict contributions on your instance to keep it somewhat manageable? Are contributions blocked by geolocation?
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:12:08 - Thibaultmol: <@Seppe:matrix.org "1) "federated" in my mind means ..."> eum...
they had an example (but it seems to be offline atm) called api.paronaramax.xyz which showed both ign-fr and osm-fr on the same map. And when you clicked on it, you could see which instance each image is on
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:12:15 - Seppe: 3. Is there already a Data protection impact assessment?

Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:12:29 - Thibaultmol: they would prefer every chapter to have it's own server
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:12:37 - Thibaultmol: the whole idea of decentralizing it
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:12:47 - Thibaultmol: they don't actually have any restrictions atm iirc
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:13:02 - Thibaultmol: they did say we could use their server just as a test... 
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:13:11 - Thibaultmol: but just a small batch of images, not the entire backlog

The question was brought up at the OSMF board ama. But I don't think it was clear to the board what the person asking the question meant. well.... the perosn did ask if osmf would host a panoramax instance. Which: obv no.
But I think maybe the 'meta' server where you can view all the other instances, I think that they might be be able to do
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:16:40 - Seppe: BTW, Thibaultmol , you know I don't expect all the answers from you, don't you? ‚ò∫
Mon, Nov 13, 2023, 23:17:20 - Thibaultmol: although they did point out that they already are short staffed and stuff.. so .... but it would make sense for them to host it ... although someone on the board did point out that you know... overpass isn't hosted by osmf, even though it's pretty freaking important to osm. and many other services lik osmcha.

The consumer: should not really need to care
The uploader: should obv have to choose the instance where they upload

Tue, Nov 14, 2023, 20:13:20 - MikiDi: I think this relates in the sense that for Flanders, the government provides base-stations, whereas in France, farmers got together to set this up (at lower cost than paying commercial providers). I interpret that the service currently is provided for free for everyone within some fair use. Best way to find out is to apply for an account I guess

Mon, Nov 27, 2023, 22:06:14 - joost_schouppe: nope... I'm also surprised by the low number of submissions. But impressed by the quality of them
Tue, Nov 28, 2023, 11:04:13 - Raf: I had a personnel discussion with Thibault, to transfer the backups of my mapillary uploads.

Best practice?

- Every x-ty giga or so, I can send a link of the map on my one-drive
Easy for me, I think it's save, but I'm not a specialist.

- Wormhole doesn't seems to fit for this quantity of files or data

- OSM could buy some 512 chips to exchange the uploads by snailmail
Also easy for me: boomers still like to stick stamps...

Any other ideas?

Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 17:05:12 - joost_schouppe: I've finally moved the starters manual to the wiki and translated it all to English: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Belgium/open_streetlevel_imagery/starters_manual
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 18:10:46 - eMerzh: currious why we recommend duplicate_distance 3... like there 's often a difference between seeing a sign and not seeing it with 3 meters ... 

but i guess it's to avoid tooooOo much overlap 
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 18:24:55 - dentonny: What is cutoff distance?
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 18:26:03 - joost_schouppe: Hmm, 3 meters might indeed be a little strict I guess
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 18:26:54 - joost_schouppe: Cut-off is when a new sequence should be started. If you lose signal or pause the camera and start in a different place, you don't want those being in the same sequence
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 19:44:08 - dentonny: <@joost_schouppe:matrix.org "Cut-off is when a new sequence s..."> Does this also work if you delete a couple of images?
For ex: if I ride in a dead end street , I delete the images taken on the ride back. At this moment the last image taken at the end of the street jumps to the next image when I'm back at the start of that road to continue my ride 
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 19:45:41 - dentonny: Should have known that 6 months ago :/
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 20:09:18 - joost_schouppe: yes, if the cut off is more than the distance. I've had the same issue if it's only just a few images
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 20:09:27 - joost_schouppe: this only works in the command line tool AFAIK
Sun, Dec 3, 2023, 20:46:31 - dentonny: The only option the desktop uploader has, is to interpolate images 
Mon, Dec 4, 2023, 11:38:38 - dentonny: personally I wouldn't use the duplicat_distance command because when I notice trafficsigns/streetsigns/walkingnodes/etc. I slow down, hoping there is a sharp image taken.
imho it's only usefull if you have to stop at traffic lights so those images are automatically skipped
Mon, Dec 4, 2023, 15:11:55 - Raf: "Double-check your settings: many people have come back from a long shoot having accidentally shot traditional images or video, instead of 360 timelapse"
to add to the manual: "If the settings are checked and correct, lock the screen"
Gives good results!

Mon, Dec 4, 2023, 16:26:50 - Raf: While using the OSM camera, each upload to Mapillary I had to switch manually from personnal to organisation account. I did not find a way to fix this in some preference. Can it be fixed?

Sun, Dec 17, 2023, 16:15:32 - Raf: A funny thing happened to me last Friday.

I checked the GoPro only after 15km.
The screen was on, indicating 430 pictures taken.üòñ
The camera was completely blocked, no reaction on any button.
I had to take out the battery to restart it.
Afterwards, no problems anymore.
I hope this is a rare bug.
As it is brand new, I had not yet done any formatting.
I‚Äôll do that more often.üòÖ

Tue, Dec 19, 2023, 00:34:02 - thierry.js1030: the local section of Fietsersbond in Heusden-Zolder is making video articles of slow roads in their municipality and they're using this camera üëÜÔ∏èüëÜÔ∏èüëÜÔ∏è

Tue, Dec 19, 2023, 04:28:46 - Rapha√´l_PasLoin: Yes and no. It's not "embended" on the camera itself like the gopro max. So you have to use the app on your smartphone that send gps coordinates to the camera or use their remote control gps module (+- 80 ‚Ç¨)

What's the easiest way to update the timestamp for 10.000 photos using these ?
Mon, Dec 25, 2023, 23:22:03 - St√©phane De Greef: or should i just not bother about exact time and only batch-update the date to 15-04-2023 ?

`exiftool -geotag yourgpxfile.gpx /path/to/the/folder/the/images/are/in`

Tue, Dec 26, 2023, 10:55:31 - St√©phane De Greef: waita minute
Tue, Dec 26, 2023, 10:55:38 - St√©phane De Greef: the geotag is right I only need to change the date
Tue, Dec 26, 2023, 11:03:22 - St√©phane De Greef: oh but there's probably even a way to get the image date:time with the GPS date:time info - I imagine both are in the file

Almost ten years ago, they put up a sign for the same reason: https://www.hln.be/aalter/borden-aan-barslecht-fietspad~a605c53a/

I guess they hoped the situation would improve automagically.

Mon, Jan 8, 2024, 15:35:27 - Thibaultmol: (I'm not going to. But imagine: someone photoshopped a road closure sign on the actual road there and then spread a fake road closure Facebook post.
Causing the outrage and highlighting the problem with the cycle path.... Again. Not going to do that. But I wonder if that would work)
Mon, Jan 8, 2024, 15:46:51 - joost_schouppe: Reminds me of a Lemmy post I just saw. They captioned an image of a Palestinian girl being held at gunpoint by Israeli soldiers as Ukrainian/Russian to trigger hypocrisy
Mon, Jan 8, 2024, 18:18:04 - Thibaultmol: only vaguely related to this channel. But basically openai made a model (then someone else forked it and improved it) that basically is a GeoGuessr bot. It can find out where in the world it is based on limited data in an image

This is a real pity, because most of these images are really valuable (I used to link them to entities added while resolving the note). This would be a prime case to funnel towards Geovisio? Somebody aware of talks on that?
Wed, Jan 10, 2024, 20:57:29 - thierry.js1030: <@mikidi-2:matrix.org "I only just learned that images ..."> that's why I am using MapComplete (images permanently stored at imgur) and Wikimedia Commons. But indeed a pity that pictures are not stored with StreetComplete

Tue, Jan 16, 2024, 21:06:09 - Thibaultmol: Have heard this before yeah. Could ask them to whitelist the facebook cdn atleast
Tue, Jan 16, 2024, 21:06:53 - Thibaultmol: (I don't know how the blocking works. but if they block facebook.com but whitelist their cdn. That you can't visit facebook, but it can stil allow you to load images from mapillary and visit mapillary itself. again. depends on how their blocking is implemented)
Tue, Jan 16, 2024, 21:49:14 - MikiDi: that's the ridiculous part. Facebook d√≥es work with "enhanced tracking protection" enabled.
Tue, Jan 16, 2024, 21:50:57 - Thibaultmol: i know it's probably nothing, but maybe make a post about it in the mapillary forum
Tue, Jan 16, 2024, 21:51:15 - Thibaultmol: it might also be something on firefox's end, but is worth a shot

Mon, Jan 29, 2024, 13:00:47 - dentonny: I just took a few pictures but it seems I didn't get a GPS signal for the first 10 images. Is there a (easy) way to fix this?
Mon, Jan 29, 2024, 13:18:34 - Thibaultmol: nope, best is just to look on the gopro's display and wait for the gps icon to turn on
Mon, Jan 29, 2024, 13:18:52 - Thibaultmol: if you have a gpx recording of that trip you could retrieve it from that. but it's just 10 images. not really worth it otherwise
Mon, Jan 29, 2024, 14:02:35 - dentonny: no it wasn't from a trip, just something I wanted to capture
Mon, Jan 29, 2024, 17:36:15 - Raf: For lonely pictures I use Geosetter
Fri, Feb 2, 2024, 20:31:34 - Thibaultmol: going to post it here cause why not. was curious how much storage all of europ's mapillary footage might be (very much an estimation. it's probably below this though)
Fri, Feb 2, 2024, 20:31:37 - Thibaultmol sent an image. (Media omitted)
Fri, Feb 2, 2024, 21:46:44 - MikiDi: Extremely valuable analysis (tooling). Thanks!
Fri, Feb 2, 2024, 22:01:21 - Thibaultmol: there is no way to get this data out of mapillary except for one method: leaderboards
Using the leaderboards on the site (no api) you can get the top contributors of a given country. 
I manually took that data from each European (continent) country and used that as a data. So I'm probably missing images in Germany and some of the other top countries, but the rest fell of pretty quickly when it came to amount of images.
Then I just assume that the average 360 image is like the one from a Max (which is 3MB) and the rest are regular images (which I put at 2MB according to regular gopro image sizes).
In reality many of these images will be lower quality than this, so I'm fairly certain the actual size total is going to be lower than what I put in this spreadsheet.
The percentage of 360/pancake images is made completely by guessing. 

Fri, Feb 2, 2024, 22:04:36 - Thibaultmol: for reference to give you an idea. if you wanted to store all of europe's imagery on one server, with some level of redundancy (60 drives in total, in groups of 15, 2 drives in each group are allowed to fail)
that would be just about enough to store all of it. 
In total that would cost about 20k euro's excluding the actual server to put those drives in, or the bandwidth to then probably serve those images.
Sat, Feb 3, 2024, 08:35:56 - dentonny: <@thibaultmol:matrix.org "going to post it here cause why ..."> Germany on top. Does this have to something to do with Google Street View not being available?
Sat, Feb 3, 2024, 08:55:30 - joost_schouppe: Don't they have  a vector tile api? That should contain a reference to all the unique pictures I think
Sat, Feb 3, 2024, 11:07:43 - Thibaultmol: Hmm. I suppose. Haven't gotten there yet.
Mapillary's api is.... Interesting... To work with, from what I've heard
Sat, Feb 3, 2024, 12:35:25 - joost_schouppe: I tried but promptly gave up as there isn't much software around to use vector tiles for something else than making maps
Tue, Feb 6, 2024, 21:12:18 - dentonny: how do you add a gps to an image? I used it for moving images 
Tue, Feb 6, 2024, 21:16:59 - Raf: In Geosetter, open a jpg, add breedte, lengte and direction and save. Is that the anwer to your question?
Tue, Feb 6, 2024, 21:28:18 - dentonny: I think so

I received a camera as a gift from my wife.
I use it to capture our hikes on the trails.
Currently, I attach it to the child's backpack. It's rigid enough to keep the camera vertical. But my son is getting too heavy. I will have to abandon this option.
Can you advise me on ‚Äúclassic‚Äù backpack mounting systems?

Fri, Mar 8, 2024, 16:44:01 - Raf: I got a funny bug in my GoPro max.
At the start of a new session GoPro got the hiccup. 
It started capturing sequences of 3 and 4 pictures.
Start: https://imgur.com/a/hyexM4P
This persisted for the next 2 hours in the same session (11:34 to 13:31)
After changing the batteries, the new session I started was ok again.
End: https://imgur.com/a/ACTU6L2
The pictures seem ok.
Still loading up.
I‚Äôll wait and see.


Fri, Mar 8, 2024, 17:33:22 - joost_schouppe: This reminds me of an issue St√©phane De Greef had
Fri, Mar 8, 2024, 18:43:37 - St√©phane De Greef: Yup I had that before. It happened when you start recording soon after turning the camera on or changing battery. I suspect that it's related to a poor GPS signal. I recommend turning on the camera at least 30 seconds before acquisition. It solved the problem for me.
Mon, Mar 11, 2024, 22:28:34 - Thibaultmol: Was in the Panoramax monthly meeting today, i'll try and provide a summary later this week.
one of the interesting things I saw was that someone was using it to host 360 pictures of sewers
https://panoramax.ign.fr/#background=streets&focus=pic&map=18.16/48.585887/7.752749&pic=08d1c438-4c66-4cd8-ba30-668d01b0a5b0&speed=250&xyz=0.00/0.00/30
Mon, Mar 11, 2024, 22:29:34 - Thibaultmol: It's also pretty funny how the 'how do you change rotation and position of sequences in bulk'. Something that mapillary hasn't figured out in 5+ years is already in alpha stage on Panoramax
