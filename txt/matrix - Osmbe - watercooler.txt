I'm also a high functioning autist that doesn't seem to be so high functioning when it comes to online communication. It took me a while to get that ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Mon, Dec 25, 2023, 03:16:24 - midgard: It takes two to communicate
Mon, Dec 25, 2023, 03:19:15 - midgard: Also: communication is a skill that you can train just like any other skill
Mon, Dec 25, 2023, 03:26:48 - midgard: When I notice there's a disagreement, my self-imposed policy is to read very well what the disagreeing parties are writing and acknowledge their points; avoid emotional rhetoric such as sarcasm, mockery and passive-aggressiveness; never attack persons, only ideas and behaviour; retain respect for the personhood and dignity of other individuals even when it's not reciprocated*; not exaggerate or lie; and apologise as soon as possible when I notice I've breached this policy.

‚Üë It's not the only way, but this is a guaranteed recipe for better communication in times of conflict. If you adhere to it, you have a good chance of working things out constructively and otherwise there's no chance any reasonable mod would ban you.

*Don't let others walk over you though. But oftentimes, they will start to show respect very soon when you listen to their concerns and treat them with respect.

I've never told him, but I think I arrived at this policy by watching joost_schouppe. ü§≠ Watch him at work here: https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/osmf-local-chapter-re-application-osm-belgium/107234

An addition to this sauce is: start from the point of view of the people who disagree with you and work with them to arrive at yours, or in the process change your own mind, or reach the conclusion that you cannot agree.

(Still feel like I can learn a lot, but I really like your rules of thumb - they allow yourself to make mistakes and just correct them, instead of beating yourself up over not being perfect) 

The linked example was a tough one, because I was fuming. I had to get in the right headspace first. There is a cost to the approach - without the catharsis of a nice and good fight, I spent two days in a bad mood.

I have needled Simon at some other points, but that never went well. He's blocked me and straight up insulted me when I mocked him just slightly. 
Mon, Dec 25, 2023, 08:18:14 - W3ZZ3: Your intervention was quite impressive. 
Mon, Dec 25, 2023, 11:25:47 - midgard: It has indeed a certain cost in the form of self-restraint, yet it is also the most effective strategy I have observed so far without using tactics that I have moral objections to. (Such as emotional manipulation or violence)

I guess online communities can be quite diverse and somewhat hard to read on what they find acceptable or not? At first glance, I would expect it to be somewhat more of a level playing field? (without all the non-verbal cues and all the "noise" surrounding IRL interactions)

Fri, Jan 12, 2024, 17:59:17 - Thibaultmol: so De Lijn stop 505060 is discontinued. (it does not have Hoppin branding because it's going away they just haven't physically taken it away yet).
On the delijn website they do acknowledge it's going away.

Hoppin app though.... I don't know what dataset it uses, if it literally relies on Google Maps api (god I hope not) but they still list this bus stop as a bus stop. (you can't get a hoppin to depart from there, you need to walk to a different bus stop to get a Hoppin... but like... why is it still in the app then)
Fri, Jan 12, 2024, 22:49:26 - midgard: De Lijn's data still includes two versions of the stop: one ACTIVE (which has a validTo date in the past) and one CLOSED
Fri, Jan 12, 2024, 22:50:15 - midgard: I don't know why Hoppin does what it does, but I could imagine that they forget to check the validFrom/validTo properties
Fri, Jan 12, 2024, 22:51:34 - midgard: (For the technical peeps, here's an extract from the API that De Lijn's own website uses: https://rumores.eu/files/505060.json)

Mon, Jan 15, 2024, 13:42:45 - Thibaultmol: Hoppin is the concept of the new public transport system in Flanders of which tDe Lijn is part of the solution, so is NMBS, bike sharing, car sharing etc
Mon, Jan 15, 2024, 13:43:26 - Thibaultmol: Hoppinpunten are locations that have multiple serivces coming together (atleast that's the theory). So for example "there's a bus stop here, and a car sharing thing, and a train station" fore xample

They only can pickup/drop off at De lijn haltes

flex vervoer: for people with disabilities, and they can come to and from any location (but these also use the flexbus network i think)

Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:29:21 - midgard invited Luna
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:29:49 - Luna joined the room
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:30:43 - midgard: Very few things are boolean when you look closely
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:31:28 - midgard: They say autists do "hokjesdenken", but I see it in everyone
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:31:54 - Luna: I don't think we do it more often, maybe even less
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:32:41 - midgard: Probably because the "hokjes" don't match up with what the others expect, so you're forced to give them up
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:33:09 - midgard: I say "you", I could also say "we", although I do not have an autism diagnosis
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:33:20 - Luna: Yea that's a reasonable explanation
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:33:24 - midgard: (Because it was never tested)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:33:41 - Luna: And the professional diagnosis isn't accurate
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:33:54 - Luna: Anyways what's this watercooler room?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:34:02 - Luna: Is there free water here or?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:34:59 - midgard: Yes! And we have a talk, meeting colleagues while getting some water (that's the analogy, from offices)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:35:59 - Luna: Ah yes, I've never worked, but on my department at uni we always drank tea
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:36:29 - Luna: Both my promotor and supervisor were British sooo
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:40:39 - paul.brunner: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "Very few things are boolean when..."> I guess things are either boolean or they're not. 
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:41:25 - Luna: Therefore they're boolean!
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:41:29 - midgard: ... You know, even that... Some things might be *more* boolean-like then others? üòÅ
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:41:51 - midgard: So gender is a boolean: my gender is "no"
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:42:18 - Luna: Was about to say "I identify as false" lol
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:42:37 - Luna: Funny how we both went for the false option instead of true

Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:46:56 - Luna: Literally
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:47:18 - Luna: During meetings my promotor often asked what tea I wanted lol
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:47:36 - midgard: Naturally
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:48:08 - Luna: You sound like a tea drinker
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:48:21 - midgard: Why yes, of course!
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:48:48 - midgard: But not a *very* advanced one, just a regular one
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:49:08 - Luna: So I think we can represent this as a boolean value: drink tea or don't
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:49:24 - midgard: ü§î
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:49:57 - midgard: I don't think I know literally anyone who would be completely "false"
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:50:25 - midgard: But yes, tea drinking is a quite clear-cut action, there's not even much ontological confusion possible
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:50:57 - Luna: I think at this point it's pretty safe to assume you're autistic lol
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:51:44 - Luna: Even "with or without milk" isn't boolean because it can depend on the type of milk

Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:53:15 - Luna: Well there's a reason labelling exists
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:53:39 - midgard: Yes, so it's easy to say "it's *you* who has the disorder!"
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:53:47 - Luna: To convey the essence of who you are, NOT to describe it fully

Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:57:18 - midgard: Do you still experience some challenge there? (Like I've done now)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:57:49 - midgard: I mean, daring to challenge ideas
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:57:50 - Luna: Within the community? Not really
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:57:54 - Luna: Outside, sure
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:58:45 - midgard: Challenging ideas is important for me, and it's certainly not something to be taken personal when an idea you have is objected to
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 10:58:51 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "I mean, daring to challenge idea..."> I mean there's absolutely no need to label yourself, but my experience (mainly from fedi) is that a lot of ND people do that
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:00:49 - midgard: What I'm getting at: from the outside, I just have the impression that some of these communities are a bit confirming each other's problems too much, while problems aren't so definitive. Which is one reason I'm not thrilled to join one
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:02:05 - Luna: There's little harm in confirming other's problems, because we're assuming others are honest about them
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:04:01 - s8evq: Are any local belgian OSM mappers also climbers? I see a lot of well tagged climbing gyms.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:04:26 - midgard: Oh yes, I don't doubt that. Just that you can shape your environment to have less problems, and then experience personal growth wherein you build capacity to deal with problems in other situations
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:04:49 - midgard: The mindset of how you deal with problems is so important
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:05:11 - midgard: (Views expressed are my own)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:05:34 - midgard: pietervdvn and I are both climbers
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:05:57 - midgard: I once did some web search for words like "climbing gym" and mapped all that I found in Flanders :D
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:06:04 - s8evq: There's a new gym in Oudenburg, probably close to both of you.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:06:15 - midgard: Already mapped

Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:06:59 - s8evq: Yes, after a 15 year hiatus, I started climbing there again :)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:07:39 - midgard: \o/
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:07:50 - Luna: Often the problem lies in what you cannot control yourself rather than in what you can
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:08:23 - Luna: This is a main issue I see with the Belgian autism ‚Äútreatment‚Äù approach: there's a difference between what's a personal issue and what's a systemic (sociological) issue and those should be treated differently
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:09:21 - Luna: Mindset can help, but it shouldn't be an excuse to conceal systematic issues as being personal in order to not have to fix them nation-wide
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:11:22 - midgard: I climb in Ghent (boulder, toprope, lead) mostly. Zeebrugge (boulder) and Brugge (toprope) are closer for me. Oudenburg (18 km by bike) is a bit further than Ghent (8 km by bike, then train, 3 km by bike)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:11:37 - midgard: Hang on, this is not as big a difference as I thought
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:12:11 - s8evq: I didn't know Zeebrugge has a boulder gym.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:12:50 - s8evq: It look nice.

Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:16:54 - midgard: I'm a big fan of improving society too, instead of focussing on individuals
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:17:50 - midgard: About me having autism, it's also documented that people with high intelligence, creativity, curiosity and fearless thinking are often misdiagnosed with autism
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:18:29 - Luna: Belgium is a tough case because the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù healthcare procedures are so widespread, people often see a therapist before knowing the autistic community.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:18:31 - midgard: I don't understand anything about autism diagnosis (I plan to investigate some time), so I can't comment a lot more
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:18:43 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "About me having autism, it's als..."> What type of diagnosis are you talking about here?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:18:57 - midgard: Autism
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:19:03 - Luna: Forget professional ones (well don't forget them entirely, but in this context)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:19:06 - midgard: And ADHD too, for that matter
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:19:38 - midgard: I don't understand "what type of diagnosis" and "forget professional ones" together
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:19:44 - Luna: Essentially, professional diagnoses merely answer the question ‚Äúdo I meet the exact wordings of the DSM-5?‚Äù, while self-diagnoses answer the question ‚Äúdo I have <neurotype>?‚Äù
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:20:06 - Luna: So you should choose a professional dx or self-dx depending on what information you're trying to obtain.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:20:36 - Luna: Want to find out whether you're autistic? Do a self-dx. Want some kind of government recognition for your autism? Get a professional dx.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:21:05 - Luna: So, ‚Äúmisdiagnosed‚Äù in this context only means ‚Äúdoes not meet the criteria of the DSM-5‚Äù, and those criteria aren't accurate in any case.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:22:16 - midgard: "Misdiagnosed" meant "patient's behaviour meets the criteria of the DSM-5 so he's autistic" while actually there isn't an autism neurodevelopment disorder at the basis
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:22:43 - midgard: So, autistic-like behaviour for reasons other than an autism neurodevelopment disorder
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:22:51 - Luna: Ah well then you have a false positive instead of the false negative I mentioned but both are false in the end.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:23:09 - Luna: Also, the basis for both is that the DSM-5 criteria are inaccurate.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:23:22 - Luna: Or for nuance maybe I should say ‚Äúincomplete and overly restrictive‚Äù.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:23:53 - midgard: Or, for the case of the profile I described, not restrictive enough
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:24:25 - Luna: No, extending them only would exclude more cases because the symptoms of autism vary so much.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:24:33 - s8evq: I'm mostly going on thursday evening, but I can choose actually
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:24:52 - s8evq: Monday or thursday preferably :)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:24:57 - Luna: The essential problem here is that the medical industry (and I'm deliberately calling it an ‚Äúindustry‚Äù) constantly attempts to categorise stuff which isn't categorisable.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:29:29 - midgard: > because the symptoms of autism vary so much.

So much that I have no idea what it actually is
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:29:48 - midgard: It seems to be defined in terms of symptoms, but then the symptoms vary wildly? What is this madness? :p
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:30:19 - Luna: If you look at this for long enough you start to see the parallel with binary gender.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:30:40 - Luna: In the end what matters is ‚Äúcan I relate to other autistic people‚Äù, ‚Äúdo some symptoms overlap‚Äù etc.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:31:17 - Luna: I'd even go as far as saying that no psychological condition can be defined by an exhaustive list of symptoms, because by definition you cannot know what will be discovered in the future.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:31:32 - midgard: That's where I personally mostly just ignore the "autism" label and ask the questions "can I relate to other people", "do some personality traits overlap"
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:34:11 - Luna: Well the reason some people label themselves is for ease, you can put ‚Äúam autistic‚Äù in a bio but not list all of your symptoms (also that'd possibly give privacy issues).
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:34:17 - Luna: Same with gender labels in the end.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:34:52 - midgard: I'm on the fence on what that helps with
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:35:08 - Luna: What does that mean?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:35:28 - midgard: I'm on the fence = I don't know what to think
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:36:01 - Luna: Well if you just look at the current situation, some people seem to prefer labelling themselves while others do not.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:36:23 - Luna: So that's purely descriptive. Then one could hypothesise why that is the case. Which is what I tried to explain.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:36:59 - midgard: The people where I've noticed the labelling most (irl, and on internet profiles) is those where they take it as an excuse not to be considerate of others
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:37:14 - midgard: (This is certainly just my impression which may be biased)
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:37:27 - Luna: Well, define ‚Äúothers‚Äù
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:37:30 - midgard: Autism is not an excuse to be a self-centered asshole
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:37:50 - Luna: There's no reason to be considerate of people who want you dead
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:37:59 - midgard: <@queerthoughts:matrix.org "Well, define ‚Äúothers‚Äù"> You mean to explore the concept of the Self?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:38:31 - midgard: <@queerthoughts:matrix.org "There's no reason to be consider..."> I'm not talking about interactions with people who want autists to die
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:39:08 - Luna: You mean others within the ND community or?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:39:51 - midgard: A friend of a friend got an autism diagnosis and started acting all self-righteous and saying "it's just my autism, I can't help it"
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:40:31 - Luna: Well there's 2 things here, (1) what I pointed out earlier about sociological issues and (2) why put the burden on the victim?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:41:40 - Luna: That's an ethical question of course, but is it really preferable to ask a group which already has severe issues even surviving to further conform to a norm that isn't even what humans used to be like?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:41:59 - Luna: Or is that just because NTs always want minorities to adapt to the majority?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:43:10 - midgard: The friend is autistic too, and she's not imposing unrealistic norms on others. In fact, she's one of the most open-minded and accepting people I know. I can't share a lot more about the situation for reasons of privacy, alas
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:43:55 - Luna: I assume you're familiar with the paradox of acceptance and the related ‚Äúviewing acceptance as a social contract‚Äù?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:44:05 - Luna: That's essentially the reasoning behind it.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:44:18 - Luna: Tolerance*
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:44:25 - midgard: <@queerthoughts:matrix.org "There's no reason to be consider..."> I'm from another school of thought but I'm threading on thin ice here, so I'll just offer a video: https://invidious.fdn.fr/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:45:01 - midgard: Not that I expect this from others, but this is my school of thought
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:47:01 - midgard: I'm familiar with the paradox of tolerance, but my solution to it is to think more systemically. How can I act in a way that makes others act nicer to me, creating a self-reinforcing virtuous circle?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:47:09 - Luna: I mean the paradox of tolerance is flawed because it uses itself as the assumption (but then so does a lot of physics??), yet still there are cases which support this, although there are also cases which indicate the other (the cordon sanitaire against VB clearly didn't result in them dying off).
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:47:37 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "I'm familiar with the paradox of..."> Well I think the paradox assumes that people never change their mind or personality, while you're assuming they can.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:48:04 - midgard: Not only they can, they are very likely to if you show that you're a compassionate person
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:48:24 - Luna: There's also the ethical question of course: apart from ‚Äú*can* we work with the rest‚Äù, ‚Äúdo we *want* to work with the rest‚Äù?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:48:27 - midgard: In personal matters of course, which includes not going to toxic online swamps
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:48:34 - Luna: Yes
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:48:59 - Luna: In self-regulating smaller communities, connecting with the broader society often means giving more and taking less.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:49:20 - midgard: Not wanting to work with others is self-destructive for the individual and anti-social, I reject that
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:49:37 - Luna: Well would you work with anyone then?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:50:02 - midgard: No, but you're lumping all of "the rest" together here
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:50:16 - midgard: There are people from anywhere that I would like to work together with
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:50:40 - Luna: I think you could put it as ‚ÄúI have a problem with person X‚Äù but then ‚Äúmy group has a problem with group X‚Äù
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 11:52:34 - Luna: The autistic community in Belgium is well ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù into the regular society (compared to other countries), and what benefit exactly does that provide? Healthcare on an oudated model? Medication only on prescription basis? Gradual breakdown of the autistic community?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:01:18 - midgard: I am not familiar with how well integrated autism is compared to other countries, but some benefits that I can imagine that could be there: that other people are more aware and considerate of the challenges we face; that people are more open-minded when encountering other people; that there is less group-think in autism-related communities and other communities
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:04:47 - midgard: Let's say Thursday 15 Feb then!
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:05:18 - Luna: The issue is that those benefits do not actually arise. Yes, some countries (e.g. US) are more polarised, but this isn't specific to autism. Autism awareness is maybe higher in Belgium compared to average, but then again, a lot of this ‚Äúawareness‚Äù is outdated medical information, so this is of absolutely no benefit to the community. If I think about how much time I spend debunking myths about autism which aren't spread online, but are spread by conventional media and even the medical sector, that is something I find shocking.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:05:57 - Luna: Even if those benefits would result, which isn't the case (at least no fully), the disadvantages would still vastly outweigh the advantages.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:06:29 - midgard: Ah yes, such as https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2023/04/13/voor-het-eerst-medewerker-met-autisme-aan-de-slag-bij-infrabel/
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:06:51 - midgard: This headline and article are absolutely ridiculous
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:07:12 - Luna: In the end, the person that knows ‚Äúyou‚Äù best is always ‚Äúyou‚Äù, so the community that knows itself best is always itself, and this is why I'm an advocate for community self-regulation.

Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:08:04 - Luna: The whole Belgian approach to ‚Äúhelping autistic people find a job‚Äù is also a very good example of why I think integration within the broader society is not necessary good.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:09:07 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "*Highly* doubt"> Could be the first with a recognised diagnosis though.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:09:34 - midgard: Not sarcastic, I object that they're portraying people with autism spectrum disorder as one type: the type that likes repetitive things
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:10:07 - midgard: And that it's so uncommon for people with autism to find a job that this would be the first one at Infrabel
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:11:23 - midgard: <@queerthoughts:matrix.org "Even if those benefits would res..."> I find that a hard to accept conclusion. Are you advocating for segregation here? On what domains?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:13:19 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "Not sarcastic, I object that the..."> Yes, and again, this is a very narrow description of what autism is.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:14:59 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "I find that a hard to accept con..."> There aren't many examples of the ND community self-regulating (because it's not recognised), but the examples that exist generally indicate that self-regulation works. Same goes for the ADHD community (disclaimer: I don't have ADHD, neither diagnosed nor suspected, but I ran an ADHD Discord server for a few years; someone with ADHD ran it and I did the technical side of things) and the gender-diverse community.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:16:35 - Luna: This is a statement I make quite often: the reason I'm an advocate for self-regulation is not because I think segregation is good, integration is bad, or I hate the government or others. In the end, it's all a spectrum, and neither extreme is of advantage. But the current situation is far leaning *away* from self-regulation, and we should attempt at getting closer to that. Unless evidence pops up disproving its functioning.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:20:50 - midgard: I agree that having such places is a good idea and I'm not questioning that they can be self-governing. But it looked like you are blanket-opposing integration of neurodiversity into wider society, which seems to contradict your goal of societal change. The problem of less active autism communities you raise seem also rather simple to solve (compared to the rest of the problems lol): have healthcare professionals spread the word that there are support communities
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:22:03 - Luna: Except that healthcare ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù often spread the opposite: that you should seek professional help. And if they point you to ‚Äúsupport groups‚Äù, these are all too often also government-organised.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:22:31 - midgard: I see
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:22:47 - Luna: It's not just a coincidence that in countries with better healthcare, autism communities are less tight.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:23:02 - midgard: You're often referring to it as _the_ community, is there a single one in Belgium that you're thinking of?
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:23:54 - Luna: I often give this example: as a Belgian what to do when you suspect you have autism, they will tell you to see a therapist or get a diagnosis. Ask that in most countries and they will advise you to find other autistic people and talk with them.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:24:48 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "You're often referring to it as ..."> It's just a way of saying, everyone who (1) is autistic and (2) labels themselves as being part of the community (some people don't and that's fine). Compare with ‚Äúthe transgender community‚Äù or even ‚Äúthe OSM community‚Äù.
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:26:42 - midgard: I have to go now. Thanks a lot for the nice discussion!
Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 12:26:59 - Luna: See you! And no problem!

Wed, Feb 7, 2024, 20:59:47 - midgard: I wonder what made you think that it's "pretty safe to assume I have autism". Are you aware of it and could you point it out?

That's a weak basis, though, and you need something stronger than my word. When I have the time (most likely tomorrow), what about I do the tests on the links you shared, and see what results I get?
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 11:26:18 - Luna: Alright midgard, here are my results:
AQ: 32
Aspie-quiz: 54/119, 99 % chance of being NT
CAT-Q: 45
RAADS-R: 72
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 11:26:42 - Luna: So there's a big difference between us except for the Aspie-quiz one, which seemed to be a bit outdated to me anyway.
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 11:27:09 - Luna: Also other comment: the Aspie-quiz one asks about your gender assigned at birth and country, neither of which is relevant. Red flag?
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 11:33:29 - Thibaultmol: <@queerthoughts:matrix.org "Also other comment: the Aspie-qu..."> as one if it's questions to base it's score on or just in general?
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 11:34:43 - Luna: Prior to taking the test, they ask about your year and month of birth, sex assigned at birth, country and some prior diagnoses.
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 15:09:39 - midgard: <@queerthoughts:matrix.org "Also other comment: the Aspie-qu..."> I think that's for their stats
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 15:13:44 - midgard: What bothered me most was that there was no option for "unknown" for the autism/ADHD fields, only "no", "suspected/self-diagnosed" or "professionally diagnosed". Like, why do you think I'm taking this test, ya silly
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 15:16:51 - midgard: As well as some quizzes having questions of "I learned social behaviour by copying others". Well, yes, *duh*, everyone does that, not everyone has to do it intentionally or is conscious about it. I am conscious of these sociocultural memes, but I don't have to make an effort to learn them.
Asking such dorky questions quite lowers my confidence in the test
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 15:23:10 - midgard: I'm not disregarding signs of intuition, "crowd-sourced intuition" is great for finding possible correlations. But indeed, it's not enough to make conclusions off when the results matter
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 20:18:44 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "I think that's for their stats"> If it's for their stats, the field should be ‚Äúgender‚Äù, not ‚Äúsex assigned at birth‚Äù. It is not relevant.

Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 20:21:00 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "I'm not disregarding signs of in..."> My intuition is just like the ‚Äúgaydar‚Äù concept: as you say, not enough to draw conclusions from. What I find more interesting, though, is that you said multiple people noticed it before. Even if you're not autistic, maybe this could be a sign of some other neurotype (or ‚Äúcondition‚Äù)? Still worth looking into IMO.
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 20:36:40 - W3ZZ3: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "As well as some quizzes having q..."> I was raised in a bar. My mom, a single parent, always explained to me what behaviour was to be expected from me. This all to be a good bartender. She didn't realize that her training gave me the skills to be undetected. I've learned that people expect eye contact from time to time. I learned to cater to peoples needs. That's why it was hard to believe when I got diagnosed with ADD/ASS aged 29. At the meantime the sky cleared and things connected.¬†
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 23:33:01 - midgard: It's only just two people though: one close friend and someone else when they were drunk. The rest seem to be "meh, could be", or are just not telling

Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 23:40:51 - midgard: If it can help with challenges I face, sure. I'm already doing that in fact: I found a nice book
Thu, Feb 8, 2024, 23:49:35 - Luna: <@midgard:matrix.rumores.eu "But to what end?"> I mean it's not required or anything, but it can help with developing your identity (if you never thought about this, ignore it), or indeed, if there are specific symptoms you find annoying, could help.

I waited with contacting them because I assumed that they were still just busy changing those but it's been a month now and a lot of signs that I pass seemed to not have been changed yet. so I have a suspicion that something has gone wrong internally

Thu, Feb 29, 2024, 14:38:00 - midgard: How?
Thu, Feb 29, 2024, 16:06:45 - Luna: I was in a section (one class 41 DMU if you're a fellow train nerd) that was supposed to be closed off, but wasn't. Conductor checked but not properly, closed the entire section, so I couldn't get off anywhere except at the terminus. Normally I only needed to go one stop ü•¥
Thu, Feb 29, 2024, 16:07:05 - Luna: I talked to the conductor afterwards, he was very friendly and apologised a number of times for the mistake he made lol
Thu, Feb 29, 2024, 20:13:43 - midgard: Hm, and I suppose in those coaches there's no passenger alarm like there is in the M6 and M7 (and I11 too maybe? Not at all sure actually)
Thu, Feb 29, 2024, 20:14:38 - midgard: A few weeks ago I got to use the passenger alarm because there was *ambras* between some passengers

Thu, Feb 29, 2024, 20:36:48 - midgard: Those "assistance" buttons in M6 the train guards call the passenger alarm and they're what sets off the *terrible* alarm sound

Thu, Feb 29, 2024, 20:37:18 - midgard: M7 and Desiro have a different solution with an intercom, indeed

Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:26:58 - Luna: Wheelchair accessibility depends on the type of rolling stock, so the development of an app like this implies that a database with the rolling stock per route is used, and such information isn't open data as far as I know (but something us train nerds are always looking for üòÖ)
Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:29:21 - Luna: <@thibaultmol:matrix.org "sent an image."> I'm also surprised to see it says you can take 18 bikes here. The 513 (on weekdays) has bicycle departments in the 2 (renovated) I10 coaches, so this would mean 9 bicycles per coach, which honestly I find quite a lot given the space available (don't even try with cargo bikes or tandems)
Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:40:22 - Thibaultmol: there's a feedback button at the bottom of the site, I recommend you ask them questions and get in touch
Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:40:52 - Thibaultmol: iirc NMBS is working with OSM for accessibility but I don't remember if this bike project currently uses it or not.

Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:46:41 - Thibaultmol: again, ask em. 
Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:46:50 - Thibaultmol: and yeah, probably not open data. Also worth asking about
Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:47:04 - Luna: Like, AM 96 or M6D, it's quite obvious what the accessibility with a bike is; I10, not so, but that's just my opinion
Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:48:03 - Luna: This assumes (for the Oostende-Eupen route) that it's all renovated I10s, but I think in practice a small amount is still run with old I10s (you can tell the difference from the windows: old can be opened, new ones can't)
Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 15:48:43 - Luna: If they're smart, they use the old I10s *with bicycle compartments*, but it's SNCB and we know how stuff goes there üòÖ
